  A dictionary with a data property that contains an array of up to `limit`
  template versions. Each entry in the array is a separate template version
  object. The previous and next page of template versions can be retrieved by
  calling the endpoint contained in the `previous_url` and `next_url` fields in
  the API response respectively.<br>If no more template versions are available
  beyond the current set of returned results, the `next_url` field will be
  empty.
