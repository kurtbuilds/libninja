          The coverage level for the country. This represents the maximum level of
          accuracy an input address can be verified to.

          * `SUBBUILDING` - Coverage down to unit numbers. For example, in an apartment or a large building
          * `HOUSENUMBER/BUILDING` - Coverage down to house number. For example, the address where a house or building may be located
          * `STREET` - Coverage down to street. This means that we can verify that an street exists in a city, state, country
          * `LOCALITY` - Coverage down to city, state, or village or province. This means that we can verify that a city, village, province, or state exists in a country. Countries differ in how they define what is a province, state, city, village, etc. This attempts to group eveyrthing together.
          * `SPARSE` - Some addresses for this country exist in our databases

          * `undeliverable` — The address is most likely not deliverable. Some components of the address (such as city or postal code) may have been found.
          * `no_match` — This address is not deliverable. No matching street could be found within the city or postal code.

          The status level for the country. This represents the maximum level of
          accuracy an input address can be verified to.

          * `LV4` - Verified. The input data is correct. All input data was able to match in databases.
          * `LV3` - Verified. The input data is correct. All input data was able to match in databases <em>after</em> some or all elements were standarized. The input data may also be using outdated city, state, or country names.
          * `LV2` - Verified. The input data is correct although some input data is unverifiable due to incomplete data.
          * `LV1` - Verified. The input data is acceptable but in an attempt to standarize user input, errors were introduced.
          * `LF4` - Fixed. The input data is matched and fixed. (Example: Brighon, UK -> Brighton, UK)
          * `LF3` - Fixed. The input data is matched and fixed but some elements such as Subbuilding number and house number cannot be checked.
          * `LF2` - Fixed. The input data is matched but some elements such as Street cannot be checked.
          * `LF1` - Fixed. The input data is acceptable but in an attempt to standarize user input, errors were introduced.
          * `LM4` - Missing Info. The input data cannot be corrected completely.
          * `LM3` - Missing Info. The input data cannot be corrected completely and there were multiple matches found in databases.
          * `LM2` - Missing Info. The input data cannot be corrected completely and only some elements were found.
          * `LU1` - Unverified. The input data cannot be corrected or matched.
