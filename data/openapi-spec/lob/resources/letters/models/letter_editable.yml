          Notes:

          - HTML merge variables should not include delimiting whitespace.

          - All pages of a supplied PDF file must be sized at 8.5"x11",
          while supplied HTML will be rendered and trimmed to as many 8.5"x11" pages
          as necessary.

          - For design specifications, please see our
          [PDF](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public.lob.com/assets/templates/letter_template.pdf)
          and [HTML](#section/HTML-Examples) templates.

          - If a `custom_envelope` is used, follow
          [this template](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public.lob.com/assets/templates/letter_custom_envelope.pdf).

          - For domestic destinations, the file limit is 60 pages single-sided or 120
          pages double-sided. For international destinations, the file limit is 6
          pages single-sided or 12 pages double-sided. PDFs that surpass the file
          limit will error, while HTML that renders more pages than the file limit
          will be trimmed.

          - Any letters over 6
          pages single-sided or 12 pages double-sided will be placed in a
          [flat envelope](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public.lob.com/assets/templates/letter_flat_template.pdf) instead of the standard double window envelope.
