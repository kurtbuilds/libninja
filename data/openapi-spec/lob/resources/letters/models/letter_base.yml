          Indicates if a return envelope is requested for the letter.
          The value corresponding to this field is by default a boolean.
          But if the account is signed up for custom return envelopes,
          the value is of type string and is `no_9_single_window` for
          a standard return envelope and a custom `return_envelope_id`
          for non-standard return envelopes.


          To include a return envelope with your letter, set to `true` and specify
          the `perforated_page`. See
          [pricing](https://www.lob.com/pricing/print-mail#compare) for extra costs
          incurred.

      perforated_page:

          Required if `return_envelope` is `true`. The number of the page that should be
          perforated for use with the return envelope. Must be greater than or equal
          to `1`. The blank page added by `address_placement=insert_blank_page` will be
          ignored when considering the perforated page number. To see how
          perforation will impact your letter design, view our [perforation guide](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public.lob.com/assets/templates/letter_perf_template.pdf).

          A nested custom envelope object containing more information about the
          custom envelope used or `null` if a custom envelope was not used.


          Accepts an envelope ID for any customized envelope with available
          inventory. If no inventory is available for the specified ID, the letter
          will not be sent, and an error will be returned. If the letter has more
          than 6 sheets, it will be sent in a blank flat envelope. Custom envelopes
          may be created and ordered from the dashboard. This feature is exclusive
          to certain customers. Upgrade to the appropriate
