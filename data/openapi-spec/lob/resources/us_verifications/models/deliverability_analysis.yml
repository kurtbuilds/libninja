      Result of Delivery Point Validation (DPV), which determines whether or not the address is deliverable by the USPS. Possible values are:
      * `Y` –– The address is deliverable by the USPS.
      * `S` –– The address is deliverable by removing the provided secondary unit designator. This information may be incorrect or unnecessary.
      * `D` –– The address is deliverable to the building's default address but is missing a secondary unit designator and/or number.
        There is a chance the mail will not reach the intended recipient.
      * `N` –– The address is not deliverable according to the USPS, but parts of the address are valid (such as the street and ZIP code).
      * `''` –– This address is not deliverable. No matching street could be found within the city or ZIP code.
