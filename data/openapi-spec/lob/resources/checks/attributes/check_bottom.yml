  The artwork to use on the bottom of the check page.


  Notes:

  - HTML merge variables should not include delimiting whitespace.

  - PDF, PNG, and JPGs must be sized at 8.5"x11" at 300 DPI, while supplied
  HTML will be rendered and trimmed to fit on a 8.5"x11" page.

  - The check bottom will always be printed in black & white.

  - Must conform to [this
  template](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public.lob.com/assets/templates/check_bottom_template.pdf).
