    # Introduction


    [Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/) API 2.0 allows you to programmatically
    access and manage your organization's Smartsheet data and account information.
    The API allows you to do the following:


    * Read and update sheets

    * Manage folders and workspaces

    * Administer user accounts and organization account


    Once you scroll to the Developer Reference section, you can view code examples
    in the programming language of your choice by clicking the corresponding tab in
    the rightmost pane. Each tab corresponds to a Software Development Kit (SDK) that
    Smartsheet provides to make working in that programming language easier. See [SDKs
    and Sample Code](#section/API-Basics/SDKs-and-Sample-Code).


    NOTE: for the introduction, the rightmost pane is blank. Code samples are visible
    there at the endpoint level.


    If you have feedback on the documentation, you can reach us using the <a href="https://community.smartsheet.com/categories/api-developers">Smartsheet
    Community API Category</a>.


    # API Basics


    ## Assume User


    Allows an admin to act on behalf of, or impersonate, the user to make API calls.
    You might do this to troubleshoot a user problem or cover for vacations and sick
    time. As with cURL, the email address used to identify the user must be URI-encoded.


    An admin cannot impersonate another admin.


    NOTE: You must manually generate a token to assume user.


    ## Authentication and Access Tokens


    The Smartsheet API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization. An HTTP
    header containing an access token is required to authenticate each request.


    * To familiarize yourself with the API, you can generate a raw token. See [Raw
    Token Requests](#section/API-Basics/Raw-Token-Requests).

    * For additional security and as a recommended best practice, you should build
    an integration using OAuth 2.0. During the [OAuth process](#section/Security/Adding-Security-by-Using-OAuth),
    you will generate several API keys and, ultimately, each user will generate a
    unique access token.


    WARNING: If an unauthorized user gets a copy of this token, they will be able
    to access all Smartsheet data that you have access to, both to read and modify
    on your behalf. You should keep your tokens secure and do not share them with
    anyone. See [Security](#section/Security) for best practices.


    ## Dates and Times


    The Smartsheet API returns all dates and times in the [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time)
    time zone in [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, that is,
    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ.  If you are specifying a date and time, you should also
    send that information in ISO-8601 format. If a date/time needs to be displayed
    to an end-user in their local time zone, you must do the conversion using the
    user's time zone, which you can obtain by [getting the current user](tag/users#operation/get-current-user).


    You can optionally choose to receive and send dates/times in numeric format, as
    milliseconds since the UNIX epoch (midnight on January 1, 1970 in UTC time), using
    the query string parameter **numericDates** with a value of **true**. This query
    parameter works for any API request.


    NOTE: Some SDK methods use language-specific Date objects, which require different
    date formats.


    ## Filtering


    You cannot create or update filters using the API; however, you can query which
    rows have been filtered out and you can get filter definitions.


    For details, see [Filters object](tag/sheetsObjects#section/Filters-Object).


    ## Formatting


    To set or read formatting programmatically, Smartsheet uses a compact format string,
    **cell.format**, which looks something like this: `",,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,"`. The
    position and sample values in this string are explained in the following format
    descriptor table:


    **Format Descriptor Table**


    **Position** | **Lookup Property** | **Example Value** | **Format String**

    -----|-----|-----|-----|

    0 | **fontFamily** | 0 = Arial, default | `"0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"`

    1 | **fontSize** | 0 = 10 pt, default | `",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"`

    2 | **bold** | 1 = on | `",,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"`

    3 | **italic** | 1 = on | `",,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,"`

    4 | **underline** | 1 = on | `",,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,"`

    5 | **strikethrough** | 1 = on | `",,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,"`

    6 | **horizontalAlign** | 2 = center | `",,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,"`

    7 | **verticalAlign** | 2 = middle | `",,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,"`

    8 | **color** (text) | 4 = #FEEEF0 | `",,,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,"`

    9 | **color** (background) | 8 = #E6F5FE | `",,,,,,,,,8,,,,,,,"`

    10 | **color** (taskbar) | 9 = #F3E5FA | `",,,,,,,,,,9,,,,,,"`

    11 | **currency** | 13 = USD | `",,,,,,,,,,,13,,,,,"`

    12 | **decimalCount** | 3 = three decimal places | `",,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,"`

    13 | **thousandsSeparator** | 1 = on | `",,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,"`

    14 | **numberFormat** | 2 = currency | `",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,"`

    15 | **textWrap** | 1 = on | `",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"`

    16 | **dateFormat** | 1 = mmmm d yyyy (December 8, 1997) | `",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1"`


    NOTES:

    * Formats that have not been explicitly set are omitted in the descriptor string.
    For example, a cell that has been set to bold and italic, but has no other formats
    applied to it, has a format descriptor of <code>",,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,"</code>.

    * Use <code>GET /serverinfo</code> to return the [FormatTables](tag/commonObjects#section/FormatTables-Object)
    object, which tells you both the default settings and what formatting options
    are available.


    **Applying Formatting**


    Use the "include=format" query-string parameter on API operations that return
    detailed objects, such as `GET /sheets/{sheetId}` or `GET sheets/{sheetId}/rows/{rowId}`.
    If there is formatting other than default settings, the return includes a **format**
    property. If an object has conditional formatting, the **format** property returned
    will have a **conditionalFormat** value.


    Setting the format of a row object or column object through the API simply sets
    the baseline format for new or blank cells in that row or column.  It does not
    affect cells that already have a value.


    If you want to change the formatting of cells that already have content, for instance
    you want to make a row bold, then you have to set the format for each cell individually.


    ## Formulas


    Formulas are processed per cell in the UI. Use the [Cell object](tag/cellsObjects#section/Cell-Object)
    to manipulate formulas via the API.


    For requests, use [Update Rows](tag/rows#operation/update-rows) to add or update
    the formula in a cell.


    For response payloads, formulas (when present) are returned whenever the Cell
    object is returned, so for example, GET /sheets/(id) returns the Cell object for
    each cell and that object contains a **formula** value when the cell contains
    a formula.


    ## HTTP and REST


    The REST URL structure follows typical resource-oriented conventions.


    To get a list of sheets, use the following:


    `GET https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets`


    This returns a list of Sheet objects, where each sheet has an **id** attribute.


    To get details on the sheet with **id 123456**, use the following:


    `GET https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/123456`


    This Id pattern is repeated throughout the API. Columns, rows, cells, comments,
    attachments, or any other data element have a unique Id.


    If you don't want to make raw HTTP calls, Smartsheet also has several Software
    Development Kits (SDKs) that provide a higher level interface for popular programming
    languages. For more information, see [SDKs and Sample Code](#section/API-Basics/SDKs-and-Sample-Code).


    ## HTTP Headers


    Unless otherwise specified, all API endpoints expect request body data to be in
    [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), and the response body data is returned
    as JSON.


    The following HTTP request headers may be required, depending on the operation
    and endpoint being invoked:


    Header | Definition | Example |

    -----|-----|-----|

    **Authorization** | Required for all endpoints, except for `POST /token`. The
    access token. | Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05

    **Content-Type** | Required for POST and PUT requests. Defines the structure for
    the response. | application/json

    **Assume-User** | Optional. Allows an admin to act on behalf of, or impersonate,
    the user to make API calls. The email address used to identify the user must be
    URI-encoded. | jane.doe%40smartsheet.com


    ## HTTP Verbs


    Call the API using the following [standard HTTP methods](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html):


    * GET (to retrieve an object or list multiple objects in a specific category)

    * POST (to create)

    * PUT (to modify)

    * DELETE


    ## HTTP Status Codes


    Smartsheet uses a combination of [HTTP status codes](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html)
    and custom error codes with a descriptive message in JSON-formatted [Error objects](tag/commonObjects#section/Error-Object)
    to give you a more complete picture of what has happened with your request.


    HTTP<br/>status code | Meaning | To Retry or Not to Retry? |

    -----|-----|-----|

    2xx | Request was successful.<br/><br/>Example: 200 Success | --

    4xx | A problem with request prevented it from executing successfully. | Never
    automatically retry the request.<br/><br/>If the error code indicates a problem
    that can be fixed, fix the problem and retry the request.

    5xx | The request was properly formatted, but the operation failed on Smartsheet's
    end. | In some scenarios, requests should be automatically retried using [exponential
    backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff).


    For example, doing a `GET` on a non-existent sheet at `https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/123456`
    results in an HTTP status code of **404**, indicating the resource was not found.


    ```json

    {
      "errorCode": 1006,
      "message": "Not Found"
    }

    ```

    <br/>


    Some errors may contain a **detail** attribute set to an object with additional
    error details that may be useful in programmatically handling the error.  If so,
    it is noted in the specific API operation for which the error may occur.


    NOTE: Smartsheet has custom error codes to help you troubleshoot issues. See the
    complete [Error Code List](#section/Error-Code-List).


    ## Multi-contact or Multi-picklist: Working with Complex Objects


    New column types, such as MULTI_CONTACT_LIST and MULTI_PICKLIST, offer more complex
    ways to work with columns. Smartsheet has provided a backwards compatible way
    for these payloads to work with your existing integrations while also giving you
    a way to query for their content.


    With either column type, there are two ways of receiving the response:


    * If you do nothing to your code, column types will display as TEXT_NUMBER

    * If you use the level query parameter as detailed below, column types will display
    as MULTI_CONTACT_LIST or MULTI_PICKLIST and return a complex object (aka a non-primitive
    type)


    Smartsheet uses two indicators to help you discover changes in the return data
    for your API calls:


    * level: a query parameter that is incremented when a new feature or column type
    is added

    * version: each element in the Columns array is set to one of the following values:


    Text | Multi-contact | Multi-picklist

    -----|-----|-----|

    0 | 1 | 2


    You must use the level query parameter, for example **level=2**, to return a complex
    object with the new column type. Without the query parameter, the response will
    be backwards-compatible, that is a string.


    Use the highest possible level for each endpoint, as in the following table:


    Endpoint category | Level

    -----|-----|

    Dashboards | 4

    Reports | 3

    Sheets | 2


    NOTE: The <b>include=objectValue</b> query parameter is necessary to see the return
    as a complex value, such as actual email addresses rather than display names.


    ## Object Details vs List Summaries


    Many of the List All commands, for example, `GET /sheets`, return only an abbreviated
    object for each object returned. For full details, read a single item, such as
    `GET /sheets/{sheetId}`. In many cases, you can refine the exact object properties
    to be returned by using **include** and **exclude** query parameters.


    The JSON representation of the objects returned from the List All REST endpoints
    will only include a subset of the properties documented here. However, the objects
    returned from the Java and C# SDKs will represent the omitted properties with
    NULLs.


    ## Query Strings


    Many API calls can be modified by including one or more of these common query
    strings:


    Query Parameter | Type | Description | More Info |

    -----|-----|-----|-----|

    **allowPartialSuccess** | Boolean | If **true**, allows bulk operations to process
    even if one or more operations are invalid for some reason, for example, **allowPartialSuccess=true**.
    | [Bulk Operations](#section/Work-at-Scale/Bulk-Operations)

    **include** or **exclude** | String | When applicable for a specific object, various
    **include** or **exclude** parameters are available, for example, **include=format**.
    | Object reference or [Formatting](#section/API-Basics/Formatting)

    **includeAll** | Boolean | If **true**, includes all results, for example, **includeAll=true**.
    | [Paging](#section/Work-at-Scale/Paging)

    **numericDates** | Boolean | If **true**, allows you to input or receive dates
    in numeric format, for example, **numericDates=true**. | [Dates and Times](#section/API-Basics/Dates-and-Times)

    **page** | String | Specifies which page to return, for example, **page=4**. |
    [Paging](#section/Work-at-Scale/Paging)

    **pageSize** | Number | Specifies the maximum number of items to return per page,
    for example, **pageSize=25**. | [Paging](#section/Work-at-Scale/Paging)


    NOTE: Query strings are case sensitive. If you do not see the expected response,
    confirm that your query is formatted correctly.


    ## Raw Token Requests


    If you want to get started quickly, or are developing a standalone application
    that can run with your credentials, follow these instructions:


    1. Click the "Account" button in the upper-right corner of the Smartsheet screen,
    and then click "Personal Settings".

    2. Click the "API Access" tab.

    3. Click the "Generate new access token" button to obtain an access token.


    The access token must be sent with every API call in an HTTP authorization header
    (except for the requests to Get Access Token or Refresh Access Token). Once you
    have an access token, include it in the **Authorization** header for every request
    you make:


    `Authorization: Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05`


    The header name is **Authorization** and the value of the header is **Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05**.
    Since the access token is being transmitted in clear text, all API calls are done
    over HTTPS.


    NOTE: A best practice is to use a shared account, such as ticket-processor@example.com,
    rather than your individual work account.


    ## SDKs and Sample Code


    Smartsheet has Software Development Kits (SDKs) providing a higher level interface
    for several languages.


    Language | SDK | Sample application

    -----|-----|-----|

    C# | [smartsheet-csharp-sdk](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-csharp-sdk)
    | [csharp-read-write-sheet](https://github.com/smartsheet-samples/csharp-read-write-sheet)

    Java | [smartsheet-java-sdk](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-java-sdk)
    | [java-read-write-sheet](https://github.com/smartsheet-samples/java-read-write-sheet)

    Node.js | [smartsheet-javascript-sdk](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-javascript-sdk)
    | [node-read-write-sheet](https://github.com/smartsheet-samples/node-read-write-sheet)

    Python | [smartsheet-python-sdk](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-python-sdk)
    | [python-read-write-sheet](https://github.com/smartsheet-samples/python-read-write-sheet)

    Ruby | [smartsheet-ruby-sdk](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-ruby-sdk)
    | [ruby-read-write-sheet](https://github.com/smartsheet-samples/ruby-read-write-sheet)


    In addition to the sample application provided for each SDK, you can always view
    code examples in this document by clicking the corresponding tab in the dark-blue
    area in the rightmost pane.


    To use an SDK for development work, follow the instructions in the SDK readme
    to download and install the SDK. Then download the sample app and run it. Once
    you've run the sample application, you can clone it and use the structure it provides
    to start building your own applications.


    ## Sheets/Columns/Rows/Cells


    Sheets are composed of rows, columns, and cells. A cell is identified by the Id
    of its row and column. The following table defines these terms and points you
    to places in this documentation where you can find more information:


    UI Element | Description | More Info

    -----|-----|-----|

    sheet | A sheet can exist in a user's [Home](../../tag/homeDescription) folder,
    in a [folder](../../tag/foldersDescription), or in a [workspace](../../tag/workspacesDescription/).
    It is comprised of columns, rows, and cells, and may optionally contain attachments
    or discussions. | [Sheet object](tag/sheetsObjects#section/Sheet-Object)

    column | A Column object *defines* the type of the column, but does not actually
    contain cells. The Column Id identifies the cells in a row. | [Column object](../../tag/columnsObjects#section/Column-Object),
    [Column types](../../tag/columnsRelated#section/Column-Types)

    row | A row is a component of a sheet or report. Each row is composed of a collection
    of cells, and may optionally contain attachments or discussions. | [Row object](tag/rowsObjects#section/Row-Object)

    cell | A cell is a location within a sheet that may contain a value. A collection
    of cells comprises each row in a sheet. | [Cell object](tag/cellsObjects#section/Cell-Object),
    [Cell reference](tag/cellsRelated#section/Cell-Reference)


    ## Versioning and Changes


    Smartsheet will add new functionality and bug fixes to the API over time. Make
    sure that your code can handle new JSON properties gracefully. Also, make sure
    your code does not depend on the order in which JSON objects are returned, unless
    it is explicitly stated in this documentation.


    When there is new functionality that is not compatible with existing code, say
    in the case of a new concept, Smartsheet increments the level to indicate the
    new feature can be ignored until you are ready to implement the code to work with
    the new level.

    # Code Walkthrough


    ## Make Your First API Call


    Before you write any code, try executing API requests using a tool like [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/)
    or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). By taking your code out of the equation,
    you can isolate troubleshooting to the raw request and response.


    You must use an access token. See instructions at [Authentication and Access Tokens](#section/API-Basics/Authentication-and-Access-Tokens).
    In the examples below, replace this sample token, "ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05",
    with your actual token value.


    WARNING: If an unauthorized user gets a copy of this token, they will be able
    to access all Smartsheet data that you have access to, both to read and modify
    on your behalf. You should keep your tokens secure and do not share them with
    anyone. See [Security](#section/Security) for best practices.


    To get a list of all your sheets, try the following command:


    `curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05" "https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets"`


    In Postman, the request looks like this:


    <img src="/images/postman-sampleb.png" alt="Postman screen shot">


    The JSON result should look something like this (after formatting):


    ```json

    {
      "pageNumber": 1,
      "pageSize": 100,
      "totalPages": 1,
      "totalCount": 2,
      "data": [{
                 "id": 6141831453927300,
                 "name": "My first sheet",
                 "accessLevel": "ADMIN",
                 "permalink": "https://app.smartsheet.com/b/home?lx=8enlO7GkdYSz-cHHVus33A",
                 "createdAt": "2016-01-28T22:02:35Z",
                 "modifiedAt": "2016-08-09T17:50:06Z"
               },
               {
                 "id": 6141831453927300,
                 "name": "Sheet shared to me",
                 "accessLevel": "VIEWER",
                 "permalink": "https://app.smartsheet.com/b/home?lx=8enlO7GkdYSz-cHHVus33A",
                 "createdAt": "2016-01-28T22:02:35Z",
                 "modifiedAt": "2016-08-09T17:50:06Z"
               }
      ]
    }

    ```


    ## How to Read a Sheet Response


    Many Smartsheet API operations handle sheets, rows, columns, and cells. Each is
    identified by an Id and it is important to understand the relationship between
    these objects. Typically you loop through the columns to determine the Id of the
    columns you are interested in. Then you loop through the rows and contained cells
    to find actual values. The annotated sample response below illustrates these concepts
    by calling a very simple sheet called "Employee Roster".


    <img src="/images/Employee_roster.png" alt="Basic sheet with 2 rows and 2 columns"
    />


    Before you begin, you should already have an access token, which you used in the
    exercise above. Use the same access token for this walkthrough.


    **Step 1:** The first thing you must have is a sheetId. To find a sheetId through
    the UI, with the sheet open, click "Sheet Actions" in the left toolbar and select
    "Properties". **NOTE:** use [List Sheets](tag/sheets#operation/list-sheets) if
    you want to do this programmatically.


    <img src="/images/sheet-properties.png" alt="Image of the Sheet Properties window"
    />


    **Step 2:** Copy the sheetId into the API call, `GET /sheets`, as below:


    `curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05" "https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/6141831453927300"`


    **Step 3:** The sample request and response are displayed below. **NOTE:** while
    JSON doesn't have a comment feature, this sample uses comments to help you identify
    the objects in the response.


    ```json

    {
      "id": 6141831453927300,    // Sheet Id
      "name": "My first sheet",
      "columns": [{              // Each Column object associates column Id
                                 // to title and defines the
                                 // column details

            "id": 2517104256673668,   // Column Id
            "index": 0,
            "title": "Name",
            "type": "TEXT_NUMBER",
            "primary": true,
            "width": 150
          },
          {
            "id": 7020703884044164,   // Next column Id
            "index": 1,
            "title": "EmployeeId",
            "type": "TEXT_NUMBER",
            "width": 150
          }
      ],
      "rows": [{                       // A Row object
             "id": 564480076736388,    // Row Id
             "rowNumber": 1,

    This core hierarchy of Sheet > Column > Row > Cell is essential to working with
    the Smartsheet API. As your user's sheets grow in complexity, the responses do
    too. This walkthrough has given you some navigational aid in finding the right
    value to plug into your API calls. Use the API Reference and the example language
    tabs to learn more.

    # OAuth Walkthrough


    Apps connect to Smartsheet using [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) to authenticate
    and authorize users. If you are building an app, this documentation will walk
    you through the steps you need to authenticate your users. The Smartsheet [SDKs](#section/API-Basics/SDKs-and-Sample-Code)
    contain APIs for OAuth 2.0.


    ## First Steps


    Before you can start using OAuth 2.0 with your app, Smartsheet needs the following
    information:


    1. You must [register](https://developers.smartsheet.com/register) with Smartsheet
    to get a developer account*. The developer account gives you access to "Developer
    Tools", which is where you manage your app.

    2. In "Developer Tools", complete any required fields in your developer profile.

    3. In "Developer Tools", register your app so Smartsheet can assign a client Id
    and a client secret to the app.

    4. Review the list of access scopes. You'll need to choose which ones your app
    needs to get to a user's Smartsheet data, and then ask the user to consent to
    that access.


    After you've worked through these steps, you'll be ready to implement the [OAuth
    Flow](#section/OAuth-Walkthrough/OAuth-Flow).


    *Review the [Developer Program Agreement](https://www.smartsheet.com/legal/developer-program-agreement).


    ## Open Developer Tools


    1. Log in to Smartsheet with your developer account.

    2. Click the "Account" button in the lower-left corner of your Smartsheet screen,
    and then click "Developer Tools".

    3. Do one of the following:
      * If you need to register an app, click "Create New App".
      * If you need to manage an app, click "view/edit" for the app.

    ## Register Your App Using Developer Tools


    1. Log in to Smartsheet with your developer account.

    2. Click the "Account" button in the upper-right corner of your Smartsheet screen,
    and then click "Developer Tools".

    3. In the "Create New App" form, provide the following information:
      * Name: the name the user sees to identify your app
      * Description: a brief description intended for the user
      * URL: the URL to launch your app, or the landing page if not a web app
      * Contact/support: support information for the user
      * Redirect URL: also known as a callback URL. The URL within your application
    that will receive the OAuth 2.0 credentials

    After you click "Save", Smartsheet assigns a client Id and secret to your app.
    Make a note of these Ids for the next steps; however, you can always look them
    up again in "Developer Tools".


    ## OAuth Flow


    Your app must implement a 3-legged OAuth flow to retrieve an access token it can
    use to access Smartsheet data on behalf of an end user.

    The following diagram has an overview of the OAuth flow:


    <img src="/images/OAuth_flow2.png" alt="Simplified graphic showing what data is
    passed back and forth during OAuth flow">


    NOTE: App registration and OAuth flow require HTTPS.


    ## Access Scopes


    To access a user's Smartsheet data, your application must explicitly ask the user
    for permission. You do this by using access scopes, which enable your app to communicate
    to the user what type of operations it is performing.

    Access scopes do not override existing [access-level restrictions](#section/Security/Access-Levels).

    For example, having the access scope of **WRITE_SHEETS** does not allow your app
    to update a sheet on which the user has **VIEWER** access level.


    See [access scopes](#section/OAuth-Walkthrough/Access-Scopes) for a complete list.


    NOTE: <b>Additional Info:</b><ul><li>When you request an authorization code, you
    specify all of the access scopes you need for your app. Smartsheet encodes those
    permissions into the auth code and subsequent access token.</li><li>Your app must
    request at least one access scope, but should only request the scopes necessary.</li><li>Once
    your app attains a valid access token, it can execute a [Get Current User](tag/users#operation/get-current-user)
    operation, regardless of which access scopes were requested.</li></ul>


    ## Request an Authorization Code


    `GET https://app.smartsheet.com/b/authorize`


    `POST https://app.smartsheet.com/b/authorize`


    Initiates the process to get authorization from the user.

    Smartsheet will redirect this URL to display your app's consent page with an explanation
    of the data the app will need access to. This consent page is autogenerated by
    Smartsheet based on a combination of the information you registered for your app
    and the parameters you send with the request.


    Value | Description |

    -----|-----|

    **client_id** | Required. The client Id you obtained when you registered your
    app.

    **response_type** | Required. Indicates whether the endpoint returns an authorization
    code. Must be set to "code".

    **scope** | Required. Space-delimited list of [access scopes](#section/OAuth-Walkthrough/Access-Scopes)
    to which you are asking the user to grant access. **NOTE:** No access scopes are
    necessary if you simply need to validate that the user has a Smartsheet account.

    **state** | Optional. An arbitrary string of your choosing that is returned to
    your app; a successful roundtrip of this string helps ensure that your app initiated
    the request.


    You can view code examples by clicking the corresponding tab in the rightmost
    pane. The cURL example shows a `GET`.


    A correctly formatted Auth URL request looks like this: `https://app.smartsheet.com/b/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=dheu3dmkd32fhxme&scope=READ_SHEETS%20WRITE_SHEETS&state=MY_STATE`


    NOTE: If the user has not yet logged into Smartsheet, the redirect will first
    take them to a login page, and then display the consent page.


    At this point, the user can authorize your app to access their Smartsheet account,
    as in the following example:


    <img src="/images/developer_tools3.png" alt="Dialog box to allow or deny scopes">


    After the user clicks "Allow" or "Deny", you'll receive a response from Smartsheet
    outlined in the next sections.


    ## If the User Clicks Allow


    If the user clicks "Allow", Smartsheet redirects the user to the callback URL
    with the following parameters:


    Value | Description |

    -----|-----|

    **code** | Authorization code required to obtain access token, such as 'sample6p9qisx6a'.

    **expires_in** | Number of milliseconds code is valid once issued; this is currently
    599135 milliseconds, or approx. 10 minutes--you must obtain an access token within
    that time.

    **state** | The same value for **state** that you sent when you requested the
    authorization code.


    At this point, you should verify the **state** value matches what you sent to
    the user when you requested the authorization code. This helps you determine that
    the response came from the user and not a malicious script. If the values do not
    match, you should reject the response.


    For other error conditions, see the list of [OAuth Error Types](#section/OAuth-Walkthrough/OAuth-Error-Types).


    ## If the User Clicks Deny


    If the user clicks "Deny", Smartsheet redirects the user to the callback URL with
    the following parameters:


    Value | Description |

    -----|-----|

    **error** | "access_denied".

    **state** | The same value for **state** that you sent when you requested the
    authorization code.


    ## Get or Refresh an Access Token


    Once you’ve successfully obtained an authorization code, the next step is to exchange
    the code for an access token. (Remember, the authorization code expires after
    599135 milliseconds.)


    Access tokens expire after 604799 seconds, which is approx 7 days. Use the refresh
    token to obtain a new access token and a new refresh token. Once you obtain the
    new tokens, you must use them in place of the old ones, which are no longer valid.


    To get or refresh an access token, see [Refresh Access Token](tag/token#operation/tokens-getOrRefresh).


    ## OAuth Error Types


    Value | Description |

    -----|-----|

    **invalid_client** | The client information is invalid. Ensure your client id
    is correct.

    **invalid_grant** | The authorization code or refresh token is invalid or expired
    or the hash value does not match the app secret and/or code.

    **invalid_request** | The request parameters are invalid or missing.

    **invalid_scope** | One or more of the requested access scopes is invalid. Please
    check the list of [access scopes](#section/OAuth-Walkthrough/Access-Scopes).

    **unsupported_grant_type** | **grant_type** must equal **authorization_code**
    or **refresh_token**.

    **unsupported_response_type** | **response_type** must be set to **code**.

    # Security


    The following provides some best practices to consider when working with the Smartsheet
    API and any API keys, tokens, or other sensitive information.


    ## Adding Security by Using OAuth


    If your application requires users to be able to login with their own account,
    you must implement the full OAuth flow.


    At a high level, this involves the following steps:


    1. [Register as a Developer](https://developers.smartsheet.com/register) with
    Smartsheet so you can get access to the Developer Tools menu.

    2. Register your app to get both a clientId and client secret, which you'll need
    to store securely. Some best practices suggestions for security are below.

    3. Go through the steps in the [OAuth Walkthrough](#section/OAuth-Walkthrough)
    once you are ready to request authorization.


    NOTE: When using OAuth, be sure to review the [Access Scopes](#section/OAuth-Walkthrough/Access-Scopes)
    needed for your app and only request the necessary scopes.


    ## Access Levels


    Sheets, templates, and workspaces have an **accessLevel** attribute that describes
    the current user's access level to that object.

    This corresponds directly to the sharing and access controls of Smartsheet that
    are available through the Smartsheet UI.


    The **accessLevel** attribute has one of the following values:


    Value | Description |

    -----|-----|

    **ADMIN** | The user can edit and share the resource, and can alter the structure
    of the resource as well.

    **EDITOR** | The user can edit the resource, but cannot alter the structure of,
    delete, or share the resource.

    **EDITOR_SHARE** | The same as **EDITOR**, but with the ability to share the resource
    to other users.

    **OWNER** | The user has complete control over the resource.

    **VIEWER** | The user has read-only access to the resource.


    NOTE: Smartsheet also uses [access scopes](#section/OAuth-Walkthrough/Access-Scopes).
    Access levels describe the actual permissions a specific user has for a specific
    sheet or other resource. Access scopes describe the general categories of access
    requested by a third-party app.


    ## API Key Management


    If you've committed code to a repository before implementing these security best
    practices, here are some steps to resecure your API keys.


    For raw tokens:


    1. [Revoke token](tag/token#operation/tokens-delete)

    2. Create a [new token](#section/API-Basics/Raw-Token-Requests)


    If using OAuth for an integration:


    * Work through the [OAuth Walkthrough](#section/OAuth-Walkthrough) to regenerate
    client secrets, auth codes, and tokens.


    ## Source Code and Version control


    Never commit API keys to accessible version control systems like GitHub or BitBucket.
    Instead, you should:


    * Use an app configuration tool suitable for deploying secrets to your app, or

    * Use a config file outside of source control, or

    * Use environment variables set outside of source control.


    If you have mistakenly deployed API keys to a publicly accessible location such
    as GitHub, then you should immediately revoke those API keys, revise your application
    to use a preferred method of key deployment, and then generate new keys.


    If you need to store API keys in a database, consider the following protections:


    * Restrict access so API keys are only readable by the owner of the object

    * Restrict read privileges to the database table

    * Make sure your database or the disk the database is on is set to encrypt data
    at rest


    NOTE: When using any Smartsheet SDK, you can use the environment variable of SMARTSHEET_ACCESS_TOKEN.
    If the access token is null on input to the client builder, the SDK will automatically
    pick up the value of that environment variable.


    # Smartsheet Gov


    Smartsheet Gov has "FedRAMP Authorized" status as part of Federal Risk and Authorization
    Management Program (FedRAMP). As an API developer working on a Smartsheet Gov
    account, you should be aware of the following differences from the standard API:


    * The base URL for each API call is smartsheetgov.com instead of smartsheet.com.
    This documentation uses smartsheet.com in *all* examples.

    * Smartsheetgov.com uses a separate token from Smartsheet.com.

    * Smartsheetgov.com has a restriction on attachment types. Only the following
    attachment types are allowed: BOX_COM, FILE, GOOGLE_DRIVE, LINK, or ONEDRIVE.


    If you use a Smartsheet SDK, you need to modify the standard config file to point
    to smartsheetgov.com. There are instructions specific to each SDK on how to modify
    the config file at the following locations:


    * [C# SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-csharp-sdk/blob/master/ADVANCED.md#working-with-smartsheetgovcom-accounts)

    * [Java SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-java-sdk/blob/master/ADVANCED.md#working-with-smartsheetgovcom-accounts)

    * [Node.js SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-javascript-sdk#working-with-smartsheetgovcom-accounts)

    * [Ruby SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-ruby-sdk#basic-configuration)


    # Smartsheet Regions Europe


    Smartsheet Regions Europe is a separate data island. As an API developer working
    on a Smartsheet Regions Europe account, you should be aware of the following differences
    from the standard API:


    * The base URL for each API call is smartsheet.eu instead of smartsheet.com. This
    documentation uses smartsheet.com in *all* examples.

    * Smartsheet Regions Europe aka Smartsheet EU uses a separate token from Smartsheet.com.


    If you use a Smartsheet SDK, you need to modify the standard config file to point
    to smartsheet.eu. There are instructions specific to each SDK on how to modify
    the config file at the following locations:


    * [C# SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-csharp-sdk/blob/master/ADVANCED.md#working-with-smartsheet-regions-europe-accounts)

    * [Java SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-java-sdk/blob/master/ADVANCED.md#working-with-smartsheet-regions-europe-accounts)

    * [Ruby SDK](https://github.com/smartsheet-platform/smartsheet-ruby-sdk#basic-configuration)


    # Troubleshooting


    Should you encounter issues with the Smartsheet API while building an integration
    using a particular programming language, for example C#, Java, Node.js, Python,
    or Ruby, keep the following troubleshooting techniques in mind.


    Try executing the same API Request using a tool like [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/)
    or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). By taking your code out of the equation,
    you can isolate troubleshooting to the raw Request / Response.


    * If you receive a similar error when you execute the Request using cURL or Postman,
    this suggests an issue with the Request format or contents. Once you have the
    Request working in cURL or Postman, update your code accordingly.

    * If you can execute the Request successfully using cURL or Postman, but not via
    your code, this suggests that the Request your code is sending is somehow different
    than what you intend. Compare the (successful) Request from cURL or Postman with
    the (unsuccessful) Request that your code generates. (See step #2 below.)


    Examine the Request that your code is sending (including the HTTP verb, URI, headers,
    and Request body) and the Response that it's receiving back from Smartsheet (including
    the HTTP status code, headers, and response body).


    * If you've implemented Request / Response logging in your application, inspect
    the full trace of Request and Response in the log file. Compare the Request that
    your application is logging with the (successful) Request from cURL or Postman,
    and update your code to correct any discrepancies.

    * Alternatively, you may choose to use a tool like [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler)
    or [Charles HTTP Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) to inspect the full trace
    of Request and Response as it goes across the wire. Compare the Request trace
    that your application generates with the (successful) Request from cURL or Postman,
    and update your code to correct any discrepancies.


    Check for capitalization errors. **NOTE:** URL endpoints are all lower case, while
    object properties and query parameters are camelCase.


    # Work at Scale


    ## Bulk Operations


    The Smartsheet API supports a number of bulk operations that can operate on multiple
    objects.  Unlike single-object operations, bulk operations allow you to create,
    update, or delete

    multiple objects in a single request. For example, if you want to update 10 rows
    within a sheet, do so using a single [Update Rows](tag/rows#operation/update-rows)
    request, rather than executing 10 separate requests - one for each row.


    **Optional Bulk Operations**


    Several endpoints support optional bulk `POST` operations which exist alongside
    the standard single-object `POST`.  For these endpoints, you may pass in either
    a single object or an array of objects.

    Depending on what was passed in, the [Result object](tag/commonObjects/#section/Result-Object)
    returned contains either a single object or an array.  An example optional bulk
    operation is [POST /favorites](tag/favorites#operation/add-favorite): you can

    pass in a single [Favorite object](tag/favoritesObjects#section/Favorite-Object)
    to create a single favorite, or an array of Favorite objects to create multiple
    favorites in a single request.  Endpoints which support bulk operations are

    noted as such in the API reference documentation.


    NOTE: Most `POST` operations fail when attempting to create a single object which
    already exists (for example, favorites, shares, group members).  However, for
    the corresponding bulk operations, these endpoints do *not*

    return an error if one or more items in the array already exist.  Existing items
    are simply ignored, and the [Result object](tag/commonObjects#section/Result-Object)
    returned omits them.


    **Partial Success**


    In general, the default behavior for bulk operations is to fail outright if any
    of the objects in the request are invalid for some reason.  If successful, Smartsheet
    creates/updates/deletes all objects in the request;

    if not, no objects are changed.


    However, there are some operations that support partial success, which means the
    operation still succeeds even if one or more of the objects in the request fails
    for some reason (for example, an object is invalid). Here is another example:
    if you want to update more than one row, you send more than one row object in
    your request. If a row object is invalid, that row update will fail, but the other
    row updates will succeed.  Partial success is

    *not* the default mode for an operation and you must explicitly enable it by using
    a query string parameter.  This is noted in the documentation for operations that
    support partial success.


    When partial success is enabled, and one or more of the objects in the request
    fail to be added/updated/deleted, a standard [Result object](../../tag/commonObjects#section/Result-Object)
    is returned, but with a **message** of <b>'PARTIAL_SUCCESS'</b> (instead of <b>'SUCCESS'</b>),
    and a **resultCode** of **3**. Additionally, the object contains a **failedItems**
    attribute -- an array of [BulkItemFailure objects](tag/commonObjects#section/BulkItemFailure-Object)
    that contains an item for each object in the request that failed to be added/updated/deleted.


    ## Paging


    The Smartsheet API contains a number of index endpoints (typically denoted in
    the documentation with titles beginning with "Get All" or "List") which return
    arrays of objects.

    Examples include `GET` [/users](tag/users#operation/list-users), [/sheets](tag/sheets#operation/list-sheets),
    [/sheets/{sheetId}/columns](tag/columns#operation/columns-listOnSheet), and many
    others.  These endpoints all support pagination, meaning

    you can retrieve paged subsets of results, enabling you to process potentially
    large result sets in smaller chunks.


    **Paging Query String Parameters**


    Index endpoints all support pagination via the following optional query string
    parameters:


    Value | Type | Description |

    ------|------|-------------|

    **includeAll**  | Boolean | If true, include all results, that is, do not paginate.  Mutually
    exclusive with **page** and **pageSize** (they are ignored if **includeAll=true**
    is specified).

    **page**		| number  | Which page to return.  Defaults to **1** if not specified.  If
    you specify a value greater than the total number of pages, the last page of results
    is returned.

    **pageSize** 	| number  | The maximum number of items to return per page.  Unless
    otherwise stated for a specific endpoint, defaults to **100**.


    NOTE: Most index endpoints default to a page size of 100 results.  If you want
    all results at once, you must specify the <b>includeAll=true</b> query string
    parameter.


    **Paged Responses**


    Index endpoints all return paged responses via an IndexResult object, which provides
    paging metadata that can be used to navigate the full set of pages in the result
    set:


    Value | Type | Description |

    ------|------|-------------|

    **data**		| array  | An array of objects representing the current page of data
    in the result set.

    **pageNumber**	| number | The current page in the full result set that the **data**
    array represents. NOTE: when a page number greater than **totalPages** is requested,
    the last page is instead returned.

    **pageSize**	| number | The number of items in a page.  Omitted if there is no
    limit to page size (and hence, all results are included).  Unless otherwise specified,
    this defaults to **100** for most endpoints.

    **totalCount**	| number | The total number of items in the full result set.

    **totalPages**	| number | The total number of pages in the full result set.


    ## Rate Limiting


    **Handle "Rate limit exceeded" Error**


    To prevent abuse and undue stress on the Smartsheet servers, the API has a rate
    limiting feature (sometimes called throttling) that restricts users to **300**
    requests per minute per access token.

    Certain resource intensive operations, such as attaching a file and getting cell
    history, count as 10 requests.

    Smartsheet reserves the right to enforce this limit depending on the load on our
    systems.


    If and when the limit is enforced, any requests that exceed this limit are rejected
    with an **429** HTTP status code, along with the following JSON response body:


    ```json

    {
      "errorCode": 4003,
      "message": "Rate limit exceeded."
    }

    ```

    <br/>


    Smartsheet recommends that you design your integration to gracefully handle this
    rate limit error.

    One way of doing that would be to have your integration *sleep* for 60 seconds
    when this error is encountered, and then subsequently retry the request.

    Alternatively, you might choose to implement [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff)
    (an error handling strategy whereby you periodically retry a failed request with
    progressively longer wait times between retries, until either the request succeeds
    or the certain number of retry attempts is reached).


    **Avoid Executing "Rapid Fire" Updates**


    If the only thing your integration does is execute an [Update Rows](tag/rows#operation/update-rows)
    request once every second for the same sheet, that would only amount to a total
    of 60 requests per minute -- well within rate limiting guidelines.

    However, updating the same object in such rapid succession could result in save
    errors that negatively impact both your integration as well as user experience
    within the Smartsheet app.

    To avoid this scenario, design your integration such that API requests are never
    executed with rapid-fire succession against the same Smartsheet object.

    For maximum efficiency, consider batching up changes and submitting them in a
    single request using a [bulk operation](#section/Work-at-Scale/Bulk-Operations)
    (for example, [Update Rows](tag/rows#operation/update-rows) or [Add Columns](tag/columns#operation/columns-addToSheet).


    **Execute Requests Serially**


    Executing multiple API requests in parallel to update a specific Smartsheet object
    results in reduced performance and often results in errors due to save collisions.

    To avoid this scenario, design your integration such that API requests to update
    a specific Smartsheet object are always executed serially (that is, execute one
    request at time, not beginning the next request until the previous request has
    completed).


    NOTE: Attempts to perform multiple concurrent updates to a sheet may result in
    [error code 4004](#section/Error-Code-List/400-Level-Error-Codes).

  description: >
    Attachments can exist on a [comment](../../tag/commentsDescription/) (that
    is, within a discussion), on a [row](../../tag/rowsDescription), or on a
    [sheet](../../tag/sheetsDescription).


    # Post an Attachment


    Like the Smartsheet app, the Smartsheet API allows uploading files to sheets,
    rows, and comments.

    You can upload a file by performing either a simple upload or a multipart upload.


    A [simple upload](#section/Post-an-Attachment/Simple-Uploads) allows you to add
    a single file attachment to the specified object.

    For example, you can perform a simple upload to [attach a file to a sheet](../../tag/attachments#operation/attachments-attachToSheet),
    [attach a file to a row](../../tag/attachments#operation/row-attachments-attachFile),
    or [attach a file to a comment](../../tag/attachments#operation/attachments-attachToComment).


    A [multipart upload](#section/Post-an-Attachment/Multipart-Uploads) allows you
    to add a single file attachment to the specified object (that is, attach a file
    to a sheet, row, or comment), or to create an object and attach a file using a
    single request.

    For example, you can perform a multipart upload to [add a new comment](../../tag/comments#operation/comments-create)
    that contains a single file attachment or to [add a new discussion to a sheet](../../tag/discussions#operation/discussions-create)
    that contains a single file attachment.


    The max file size for uploads through the API is limited to 30mb.


    NOTE: Posting an attachment is a resource-intensive operation and incurs 10 additional
    requests against the rate limit.


    ## Multipart Uploads


    A multipart upload request must include the following HTTP headers:


    Header | Description |

    -----|-----|

    **Content-Length** | The length of the request payload.

    **Content-Type** | Must be set to **multipart/form-data**, and include the boundary
    string that separates the parts in the request payload.


    The request body of a multipart upload request contains one or more parts, each
    part containing either JSON or a file to upload.

    The request body must contain at least one part.

    Each part must start with the boundary string specified in the **Content-Type**
    request header, and must contain the following part headers:


    Header | Description |

    -----|-----|

    **Content-Disposition** | Contains the following semicolon-delimited items:<ul><li>**form-data**</li><li>**name="*partname*"**</li><li>**filename="*filename*"**
    (only required for file parts)</li></ul>NOTE: Values specified in the Content-Disposition
    header must be URL-encoded.

    **Content-Type** | The content type of the part: **application/json** for JSON
    objects, or the applicable MIME type for file parts


    The last part in the request must be followed by the boundary string, followed
    by two hyphens.


    The documentation for each operation that supports multipart uploads specifies
    the number and names of parts that are expected for the operation.

    File parts must have the part name "file", and documentation for operations which
    allow for JSON object parts specify the required part name for the JSON part.


    The following example shows a multipart upload request that creates a comment
    containing the specified text and file attachment:


    `POST https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/4509093797881732/discussions/2889925487028100/comments`

    `Authorization: Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05`

    `Content-Length: 29008`

    `Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----gU8h01zAAp3LagBr`


    `------gU8h01zAAp3LagBr`

    `Content-Disposition: form-data; name="comment"`

    `Content-Type: application/json`


    `{ "text": "Please review the attached image." }`

    `------gU8h01zAAp3LagBr`

    `Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="picture.jpg"`

    `Content-Type: image/jpeg`


    *< Binary content for file >*

    `------gU8h01zAAp3LagBr--`


    NOTE: Most programming languages have libraries that can be used to assemble multipart
    requests.


    ## Simple Uploads


    To perform this kind of upload, you must set specific headers to tell Smartsheet
    about the file. The following three headers are required:


    Header | Description |

    -----|-----|

    **Content-Disposition** | **attachment** to tell the API that a file is in the
    body of the `POST` request, followed by a semicolon, followed by **filename=**
    and the URL-encoded filename in quotes

    **Content-Length** | Must be set to the size of the file, in bytes. For example
    to determine file size using in UNIX: <p>`$ ls -l ProgressReport.docx`<br/>`5463
    ProgressReport.docx`</p>

    **Content-Type** | Can be left blank if it is not known (but must be present);
    Smartsheet makes its best guess based on the extension of the file.


    The following example request shows a simple upload that adds a file attachment
    to a sheet:


    `POST https://api.smartsheet.com/2.0/sheets/4509093797881732/attachments`

    `Authorization: Bearer ll352u9jujauoqz4gstvsae05`

    `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="ProgressReport.docx"`

    `Content-Type: application/msword`

    `Content-Length: 5463`


    *< Binary content for file >*


    As shown in this example, the contents of the file is included in the body of
    the `POST` request. In most programming languages, this is done by reading the
    file from an input stream and writing it out to the output stream of the HTTP
    request.

    # Cell Links


    Creating or updating cell links via the **cell.linkInFromCell** attribute is a
    special operation.

    A given row or cell update operation may contain only link updates, or no link
    updates.

    Attempting to mix row/cell updates with cell link updates results in error code
    1115.

    Additionally, a [CellLink object](../../tag/cellsObjects#section/CellLink-Object)
    can only be added to an existing cell, so the **cell.linkInFromCell** attribute
    is not allowed when POSTing a new row to a sheet.


    When creating a cell link, **cell.value** must be null (the data is pulled from
    the linked cell).


    A cell may not contain both a hyperlink and a cell link, so **hyperlink** and
    **linkInFromCell** may never both be non-null at the same time.


    # Cell Reference


    ## Cell Value Representation


    [Cell objects](../../tag/cellsObjects#section/Cell-Object) retrieved through the
    Smartsheet APIs have two main attributes representing cell values: **Cell.value**,
    and

    **Cell.displayValue**. A third attribute, **Cell.objectValue** is currently used
    only for adding and updating predecessors, or for multi-contact or multi-picklist
    details, such as email addresses or values in a multi-picklist. An empty cell
    returns no value.


    **Cell.displayValue** is always a string and is only returned for certain column
    types (see below).  It represents the formatted value as it should

    be displayed to an end-user.  For example, if a TEXT_NUMBER column is formatted
    as a US Dollar currency, its **value** may be a number

    like 1234.5678, but its **displayValue** is "$1,234.57".


    **Cell.value** represents a cell's raw value and can be one of the following primitive
    JSON types: string, number, or Boolean,

    depending on the column type.  An empty cell returns no value. Complex types are
    represented as strings, formatted as described below:


    [Help with Project Columns](https://help.smartsheet.com/articles/765737-project-sheet-columns-start-date-end-date-duration-complete-and-predecessors)


    Column Type | Possible Types for Cell.value | Returns Cell.displayValue?

    ------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------

    ABSTRACT_DATETIME | string: a project date and time in [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
    format, or a free-form text value.<br/>number: see [Dates and Times](../../#section/API-Basics/Dates-and-Times)
    for how to request dates to be returned as numbers. | No.

    CHECKBOX | Boolean: **true** if the checkbox is checked, **false** if unchecked,
    no value if the cell hasn't been touched yet.<br/>string: a free-form text value.
    | No.

    CONTACT_LIST | string: an email address representing a contact, or a free-form
    text value. | Yes: same as **value** for free-form strings; for contacts, the
    contact's name if any, else their email address.

    DATE | string: a date in [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format,
    or a free-form text value.<br/>number: see [Dates and Times](../../#section/API-Basics/Dates-and-Times)
    for how to request dates to be returned as numbers. | No.

    DURATION | string: a duration value such as "4d 6h 30m" in the user's locale,
    or a free-form text value.<br/>See the [Help Center](<%= PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL
    %>) for more information on durations. | Yes: same as **value**

    MULTI_CONTACT_LIST | string: only visible when using a query parameter of **level**
    and the value appropriate to the dashboard, report, or sheet that you are querying,
    otherwise the column type is TEXT_NUMBER. | Yes: same as **value**; to see actual
    email addresses, see below.

    MULTI_PICKLIST | string: only visible when using a query parameter of **level**
    and the value appropriate to the dashboard, report, or sheet that you are querying,
    otherwise the column type is TEXT_NUMBER. | Yes: same as **value**; to see objectValue,
    see below.

    PICKLIST | string: one of the picklist's column options, or a free-form text value.<br/>number:
    numeric values | Yes: same as **value** for strings; for number values, the number
    with formatting applied.

    PREDECESSOR	| string: a comma-delimited predecessor list such as "12FS +3d 4h,
    14SS", or a free-form text value.<br/>See the [Help Center](<%= PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL
    %>) for more information on predecessors. | Yes: same as **value**

    TEXT_NUMBER	| string: free-form text values<br/>number: numeric values | Yes:
    same as **value** for strings; for number values, the number with formatting applied.


    **Cell.objectValue** is an object representation of a cell's value and is currently
    used for adding or updating predecessor cell values, or for multi-contact details,
    such as email addresses.


    * For predecessors, it provides a more "programmer friendly" format for assembling
    predecessors. To update a cell's predecessors, set **objectValue** to a

    [PredecessorList object](../../tag/cellsObjects#section/PredecessorList-Object)
    containing [Predecessor objects](../../tag/cellsObjects#section/Predecessor-Object).

    * For multi-contact or multi-picklist details, use both a level query parameter
    *and* an **include=objectValue** query to see email addresses rather than display
    names or to see multi-picklist values.


    ## Cell Value Parsing


    The flexibility in cell value data types is a powerful feature in the Smartsheet
    application; however, it poses a challenge

    for an API in terms of parsing. Being too flexible might result in unexpected
    behavior. For instance, if you write code

    to post a Date value to a Smartsheet and the API operation succeeds, you might
    assume that the date value you sent was interpreted

    as date. What happens if you posted your date in the wrong format? Do you really
    want Smartsheet to keep the malformed date

    as a string value? Probably not.


    To address this problem, the Smartsheet API employs a simple scheme to indicate
    whether you want a more predictable and strict

    interface or a more flexible one. By default, a cell value is expected to conform
    to "strict" rules for the type of the cell's column.

    If an input value doesn't conform, the API returns [error code 1042](../../#section/Error-Code-List/400-Level-Error-Codes).


    If, however, you want the same flexibility as the Smartsheet Web app, you can
    disable the strict rules, and we’ll do our best to make

    sense of it. To enable lenient parsing simply include **"strict": false** in the
    [Cell object](../../tag/cellsObjects#section/Cell-Object) in your request body.


    NOTE: How does strict cell value parsing compare to cell validation settings?
    Strict cell value parsing determines how string values are parsed. It is set on
    a per-call basis. In contrast, cell validation is part of the column definition.
    The <b>overrideValidation</b> property is restricted to sheet admins and does
    <i>not</i> override strict parsing.


    The parsing rules for the various column types are as follows:


    **ABSTRACT_DATETIME**


    Value | Description |

    -----|-----|

    **lenient** | Smartsheet attempts to convert the string value to date using ISO
    8601 date format, as well as several locale-specific date formats. If the value
    is a parsable date format, Smartsheet recognizes the date and stores it as such.
    All other values are simply text values.

    **strict** | The value must be a string value and a valid ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD).
    Alternatively, if Unix time (also known as epoch time) is used, you can use the
    query parameter of **numericDates** set to **true** to have Smartsheet convert
    epoch time to human readable dates. See [Dates and Times](../../#section/API-Basics/Dates-and-Times)
    for more information.


    **CHECKBOX**


    Value | Description |

    -----|-----|

    **lenient** | Boolean values and string values of **true** and **false** are handled
    the same as **strict**. All other values are saved as text values.

    **strict** | Only Boolean values (true or false) are valid.


    **CONTACT_LIST**


    Value | Description |

    -----|-----|

    **lenient** | If the value is a valid email address, Smartsheet handles it the
    same as **strict**. If not, Smartsheet saves the value as a text value.

    **strict** | The value must be a valid email address. If **displayValue** is set,
    Smartsheet uses that as the name; otherwise, if Smartsheet finds a match among
    the the access token owner's contacts, Smartsheet associates this cell with that
    existing contact.


    NOTE: See [Contact List Columns](#section/Cell-Reference/Contact-List-Columns)
    for more information.


    **DATE**


    Value | Description |

    -----|-----|

    **lenient** | Smartsheet attempts to convert the string value to date using ISO
    8601 date format, as well as several locale-specific date formats. If the value
    is a parsable date format, Smartsheet recognizes the date and stores it as such.
    All other values are simply text values.

    **strict** | The value must be a string value and a valid ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD).
    Alternatively, if Unix time (also known as epoch time) is used, you can use the
    query parameter of **numericDates** set to **true** to have Smartsheet convert
    epoch time to human readable dates. See [Dates and Times](#section/API-Basics/Dates-and-Times)
    for more information.


    **DURATION**


    Value | Description |

    -----|-----|

    **lenient** | Numeric values are treated as duration values in days. String values
    which are valid duration strings in the user's locale are treated as durations,
    and any other values are treated as free-form text values.

    **strict** | Only valid duration strings in the user's locale are valid. Information
    on duration strings can be found in [Help Center](<%= PROJECT_COLUMN_HELP_URL
    %>).


    NOTE: You may use the query string parameter <b>projectParseLocale</b> with a
    [supported locale string](../../tag/serverInfoDescription) to force parsing in
    the specified locale (for example, using <b>en_US</b> lets you send in English
    values regardless of the user's locale).


    **MULTI_CONTACT_LIST**


    Value | Description |

    -----|-----|

    N/A | Set using the **objectValue** attribute for the Cell object, which is inherently
    strict. See [Cell Reference](../../tag/cellsRelated#section/Cell-Reference).


    **MULTI_PICKLIST**


    Value | Description |

    -----|-----|

    N/A | Set using the **objectValue** attribute for the Cell object, which is inherently
    strict. See [Cell Reference](../../tag/cellsRelated#section/Cell-Reference).


    **PICKLIST**


    Value | Description |

    -----|-----|

    **lenient** | All numeric and text values are valid. Formatted numbers are parsed
    like TEXT_NUMBER formatted numbers.

    **strict** | The value must be a string and must be one of the options for the
    picklist.


    **PREDECESSOR**


    Value | Description |

    -----|-----|

    N/A | Set using the **objectValue** attribute for the Cell object, which is inherently
    strict. See [Cell Reference](../../tag/cellsRelated#section/Cell-Reference).


    **TEXT_NUMBER**


    Value | Description |

    -----|-----|

    **lenient** | All numeric and text values are valid. Formatted numbers passed
    as text values, such as currencies ("$5,000"), percentages ("50%"), or decimals
    ("100.5") are parsed to their numeric equivalents, based on the locale of the
    access token owner,  with the proper formatting enabled for the cell.

    **strict** | All numeric and text values are valid and are interpreted literally.


    NOTE: The Smartsheet application only supports numeric values in the range -9007199254740992
    to 9007199254740992. If using strict parsing, any numeric value outside that range
    results in [error code 1148](../../#section/Error-Code-List/400-Level-Error-Codes).
    If using lenient parsing, the value is silently converted to text.


    ## Contact List Columns


    With columns of type **CONTACT_LIST**, the cell attributes **value** and **displayValue**
    are treated independently.

    The contact’s email address is represented by **value**, while the contact’s name
    (and the value displayed in the cell in the Smartsheet app) is represented by
    **displayValue**.


    When creating or updating cells for a contact list column, the **displayValue**
    attribute works as follows:


    * If **displayValue** is non-null and non-empty, the Smartsheet cell displays
    the value provided.

    * If **displayValue** is an empty string, the Smartsheet cell displays the email
    address.

    * If **displayValue** is null or absent, Smartsheet makes a best guess effort
    at filling it in with a contact’s name based on the email address.


    # Hyperlinks


    You can create and modify [hyperlinks](../../tag/cellsObjects#section/Hyperlink-Object)
    by using any API operation that creates or updates cell data.

    When creating or updating a hyperlink, **cell.value** may be set to a string value
    or null.

    If null, the cell's value is derived from the hyperlink:


    * If the hyperlink is a URL link, the cell's value is set to the URL itself.

    * If the hyperlink is a dashboard, report, or sheet link, the cell's value is
    set to the dashboard, report, or sheet name.

    # Column Types


    Smartsheet supports the following standard column types, which are represented
    in a [Column object](../../tag/columnsObjects#section/Column-Object) with a **type**
    attribute set to one of the following:


    Column Type | Column.type Value | Notes |

    ------------|--------------------------|-------|

    Checkbox 		| **CHECKBOX**		| Checkbox, star, and flag types

    Contact List	| **CONTACT_LIST**	| List containing contacts or roles for a project.
    **NOTE:** You can use the [contactOptions](../../tag/columnsObjects#section/ContactOption-Object)
    property to specify a pre-defined list of values for the column, which can also
    become lanes in card view.

    Contact List | **MULTI_CONTACT_LIST** | List where single cells can contain more
    than one contact. Only visible when using a query parameter of **level** and the
    value appropriate to the dashboard, report, or sheet that you are querying. To
    see email addresses behind the display names, combine an **include=objectValue**
    query parameter with a **level** query parameter.

    Date			| **DATE** |

    Date/Time 		| **ABSTRACT_DATETIME** | Represents a project sheet's start and end
    dates.<br/>**Only for dependency-enabled project sheets**<br/>The API does not
    support setting a column to this type. (This can only be done through the Smartsheet
    Web app when configuring a project sheet.) Additionally, the API does not support
    updating data in the "End Date" column under any circumstance, and does not support
    updating data in the "Start Date" column if "Predecessor" is set for that row.

    Date/Time		| **DATETIME**	| Used only by the following system-generated columns:
    <ul><li>Created (Date) (**Column.systemColumnType** = **CREATED_DATE**)</li><li>Modified
    (Date) (**Column.systemColumnType** = **MODIFIED_DATE**)</li></ul>

    Dropdown List	| **PICKLIST**	| Custom, RYG, Harvey ball, priority types, etc.

    Dropdown List	| **MULTI_PICKLIST**	| List where single cells can contain more
    than one dropdown item. Only visible when using a query parameter of **level**
    and the value appropriate to the dashboard, report, or sheet that you are querying.
    To see multi-picklist values behind the display names, combine an **include=objectValue**
    query parameter with a **level** query parameter.

    Duration		| **DURATION**		| **Only for dependency-enabled project sheets**<br/>The
    API does not support setting a column to this type. (This can only be done through
    the Smartsheet Web app when configuring a project sheet.)

    Predecessor		| **PREDECESSOR**	| Defines what must happen first in a project flow.
    For more information, see the [Predecessor object](../../tag/cellsObjects#section/PredecessorList-Object).
    **Only for dependency-enabled project sheets**

    Text/Number		| **TEXT_NUMBER**	|


    NOTE: See the [Cell Reference](../../tag/cellsRelated#section/Cell-Reference)
    section for information on getting and setting cell values for the different column
    types.


    ## Symbol Columns


    In addition to the basic column types above, the Smartsheet app also supports
    columns that display symbols. These are specialized columns of type **CHECKBOX**
    or **PICKLIST**,

    whose **symbol** attribute is set to one of the values below:


    **Symbols for CHECKBOX columns:**


    Value | Example |

    -----|-----|

    **FLAG** | <img src="/images/img_pl_flagc.png" alt="A flag symbol" /> |

    **STAR** | <img src="/images/img_pl_starc.png" alt="A star symbol" /> |


    **Symbols for PICKLIST columns:**


    Value | Example |

    -----|-----|

    **ARROWS_3_WAY** | <img src="/images/img_pl_arrows3.png" alt="An arrows_3_way
    symbol" /> |

    **ARROWS_4_WAY** | <img src="/images/img_pl_arrows4.png" alt="An arrows_4_way
    symbol" /> |

    **ARROWS_5_WAY** | <img src="/images/img_pl_arrows5.png" alt="An arrows_5_way
    symbol" /> |

    **DECISION_SHAPES** | <img src="/images/img_pl_decisionshapes.png" alt="A decision_shapes
    symbol" /> |

    **DECISION_SYMBOLS** | <img src="/images/img_pl_decisionsymbols.png" alt="A decision_symbols
    symbol" /> |

    **DIRECTIONS_3_WAY** | <img src="/images/img_pl_directions3.png" alt="A directions_3_way
    symbol" /> |

    **DIRECTIONS_4_WAY** | <img src="/images/img_pl_directions4.png" alt="A directions_4_way
    symbol" /> |

    **EFFORT** | <img src="/images/img_pl_effort6Three.png" alt="An effort symbol"
    /> |

    **HARVEY_BALLS** | <img src="/images/img_pl_harvey5.png" alt="A harvey_balls symbol"
    /> |

    **HEARTS** | <img src="/images/img_pl_heart6Three.png" alt="A hearts symbol" />
    |

    **MONEY** | <img src="/images/img_pl_money6Three.png" alt="A money symbol" />
    |

    **PAIN** | <img src="/images/img_pl_pain6.png" alt="A pain symbol" /> |

    **PRIORITY** | <img src="/images/img_pl_priority.png" alt="A priority symbol"
    /> |

    **PRIORITY_HML** | <img src="/images/img_pl_priorityhml.png" alt="A priority_hml
    symbol" /> |

    **PROGRESS** | <img src="/images/img_pl_progress5Half.png" alt="A progress symbol"
    /> |

    **RYG** | <img src="/images/img_pl_ryg.png" alt="An RYG symbol" /> |

    **RYGB** | <img src="/images/img_pl_rygb.png" alt="An RYGB symbol" /> |

    **RYGG** | <img src="/images/img_pl_rygg.png" alt="An RYGG symbol" /> |

    **SIGNAL** | <img src="/images/img_pl_signal5.png" alt="A signal symbol" /> |

    **SKI** | <img src="/images/img_pl_difficulty4.png" alt="A ski symbol" /> |

    **STAR_RATING** | <img src="/images/img_pl_star6Three.png" alt="A star_rating
    symbol" />

    **VCR** | <img src="/images/img_pl_decisionvcr.png" alt="A VCR symbol" /> |

    **WEATHER** | <img src="/images/img_pl_weather5.png" alt="A weather symbol" />
    |


    NOTE: The Smartsheet grid user interface presents several row attributes and features
    visually as columns, for example, attachments, discussions, row action indicator,
    or row number.  The API does not consider these to be columns, and does not return
    or otherwise expose them as columns.  The only columns returned by the API are
    user data columns.


    ## System Columns


    In addition to the standard column types and symbols, Smartsheet has a number
    of system columns, which represent data that is

    filled in by Smartsheet and whose values cannot be changed by the user. These
    columns are represented with standard

    [column types](../../tag/columnsRelated#section/Column-Types), with the **[Column.systemColumnType](../../tag/columnsObjects#section/Column-Object)**
    attribute set to one of the following:


    Column.systemColumnType Value | Column Type | Notes

    -----|-----|-----|

    **AUTO_NUMBER** | TEXT_NUMBER | Columns of this system column type include an
    [AutoNumberFormat object](../../tag/commonObjects#section/AutoNumberFormat-Object)
    that describes the mask used to generate the value.

    **CREATED_BY**  | CONTACT_LIST

    **CREATED_DATE** | DATETIME

    **MODIFIED_BY** | CONTACT_LIST

    **MODIFIED_DATE** | DATETIME

    The following section describes the specific event types and payloads
    returned from the Smartsheet Events API.


    With Event Reporting, you can programmatically retrieve events that are occurring
    in your Smartsheet organization account. Examples of events are create, update,
    load, and delete of sheets, reports, dashboards, attachments, and users. Note:
    while the current list of events covers most of Smartsheet functionality, new
    events will be added to the list as Smartsheet introduces new functionality.


    Some actions in Smartsheet are performed by system components. Therefore, the
    userId property in some response payloads refers to a system user and not to a
    regular user. For example, the Smartsheet Events API shows 5629504736520068 as
    the userId when an anonymous user accesses a sheet that is published for anyone.


    The list of system users is displayed below. New system userIds may be incorporated
    to this list as new features and subsystems are incorporated to Smartsheet:


    System user | Description |

    -----|-----|

    1688855062570884 | Data accessed/modified by Skype action (only possible if Smartsheet
    account is connected to Skype) |

    2814754969413508 | Data accessed/modified by Trello import action (only possible
    if Smartsheet account is connected to Trello) |

    3377704922834820 | Data accessed/modified due to Smartsheet cell-link |

    3940654876256132 | Data accessed/modified by the Smartsheet Automation system
    |

    5066554783098756 | Access to object published to any user in the Smartsheet organization
    account |

    5629504736520068 | Access to Smartsheet object published to anyone |

    # Row Include Flags


    Endpoints which return rows (for example, [Get Sheet](../../tag/sheets#operation/getSheet),
    [Get Row](../../tag/rows#operation/row-get)) support the optional **include**
    query string parameter. If specified, the value of the **include** parameter is

    a comma-delimited list of flags that indicate additional attributes to be included
    in each [Row object](../../tag/rowsObjects#section/Row-Object) within the response.


    Include Flag | Description |

    -------------|-------|

    **attachments**	| Includes row **attachments** array.<br/>To include discussion
    attachments, both **attachments** and **discussions** must be present in the include
    list.

    **columnType**	| Includes **columnType** attribute in the row's [cells](../../tag/cellsObjects#section/Cell-Object)
    indicating the type of the column the cell resides in.

    **discussions**	| Includes row **discussions** array.<br/>To include discussion
    attachments, both **attachments** and **discussions** must be present in the include
    list.

    **filters**		| Includes **filteredOut** attribute indicating if the row should
    be displayed or hidden according to the sheet's filters.

    **format**		| Includes **format** attribute on the row, its cells, or summary
    fields.  See [Formatting](../../#section/API-Basics/Formatting).

    **objectValue** | Includes **objectValue** attribute on cells containing values.
    For more information see [Cell Reference](../../tag/cellsRelated#section/Cell-Reference).

    **rowPermalink** | Includes **permalink** attribute that represents a direct link
    to the [row](../../tag/rowsObjects#section/Row-Object) in the Smartsheet application.

    **rowWriterInfo** | **DEPRECATED** Includes **createdBy** and **modifiedBy** attributes
    on the row, indicating the row's creator, and last modifier.

    **writerInfo** | Includes **createdBy** and **modifiedBy** attributes on the row
    or summary fields, indicating the row or summary field's creator, and last modifier.


    # Specify Row Location


    When you [add a row](../../tag/rows#operation/rows-addToSheet), the default behavior
    is for Smartsheet to put the new row at the bottom of the sheet. And when you
    [update a row](../../tag/rows#operation/update-rows), the default behavior is
    to keep the row where it is. It is not necessary to use a location-specifier attribute
    if you want the default behavior.


    To specify a location for new or updated rows other than the defaults, use the
    table below for reference. The table details possible row locations and provides
    JSON examples to help you construct one or more [Row objects](../../tag/rowsObjects#section/Row-Object)
    with location-specifier attributes.


    Note the following restrictions:


    * Use only one location-specifier attribute per request, unless you use **parentId**
    and **toBottom** or **siblingId** and **above**.

    * If you specify multiple rows in the request, all rows must have the same location-specifier
    attributes.

    * If you specify the **parentId** attribute, you cannot also specify the **siblingId**
    attribute.

    * If you specify the **siblingId** attribute, you cannot also specify the **parentId**,
    **toTop**, or **toBottom** attributes.

    * If you want to indent or outdent multiple rows, use the **parentId** attribute.


    Destination | Row Attributes | Examples |

    -------|--------|--------|

    Top of a sheet | **toTop** | ```("toTop": true}```

    Bottom of a sheet | **toBottom** | ```("toBottom": true}```

    Top of an indented section a.k.a., first child row | **parentId** | ```("parentId":
    8896508249565060}```

    Bottom of an indented section a.k.a., last child row | **parentId** +<br/>**toBottom**
    | ```{"parentId": 8896508249565060, "toBottom": true}```

    Below a specific row, at the same indent level | **siblingId** | ```{"siblingId":
    8896508249565060}```

    Above a specific row, at the same indent level | **siblingId** +<br/>**above**
    | ```{"siblingId": 8896508249565060, "above": true}```

    Indent one existing row, must have a value of "1" | **indent** | ```{"indent":
    1}```

    Outdent one existing row, must have a value of "1" | **outdent** | ```{"outdent":
    1}```

    # Intro to Webhooks


    At a high-level, it works like this:


    1. Your application subscribes to [callbacks](#section/Webhook-Callbacks/Event-Callbacks).</span><br/>First,
    subscribe to event notifications (callbacks) by creating one or more webhooks.  You
    can create a webhook manually via the API or have your application create a webhook
    dynamically.  Each webhook must specify:
        * Which Smartsheet object to monitor for events
        * Which events in that object should trigger a callback
        * The HTTPS URL (that is, "callback URL") where Smartsheet should send callbacks
    when any of the specified events occur within the scope of the specified Smartsheet
    object. (<b>NOTE:</b> Smartsheet webhooks do not support callbacks to servers
    using self-signed certificates)

    	  <b>Webhook examples in plain English:</b>

    	  * "When any changes occur in Sheet_A, send a callback to https://www.example.com/abc"

    	  * "When a new row is added to Sheet_B, send a callback to https://www.example.com/def"

    	  * "When a cell value is changed in Sheet_C, send a callback to https://www.example.com/ghi"


    2. When any of the specified events occur within an object that is being monitored
    by a webhook, Smartsheet sends an <b>HTTP POST</b> (that is, "callback") to the
    callback URL that is associated with the webhook.

    	  * NOTE: The callback payload is a "skinny" payload -- it indicates which objects
    changed and the type of events that occurred, but does not contain any data from
    the objects themselves.

    3. Your application receives, acknowledges, and processes callbacks.</span><br/>Your
    application receives the <code>HTTP POST</code>, acknowledges the callback by
    responding with HTTP status 200, and processes the callback. Because the callbacks
    are "skinny", make one or more requests to the Smartsheet API to retrieve the
    actual data associated with the change.


    ## Webhook Management


    Use the Smartsheet API to create and manage webhooks. See [Webhooks API Reference](#tag/webhooksDescription)
    for details about the related API operations.


    ## Webhook Ownership & Access


    Webhooks can be created and managed via [Direct API Access](../../tag/webhooksDescription)
    or by a [third-party app](#section/Third-party-App-Development).


    A webhook that is created via Direct API Access:


    * is owned by the user who created it

    * can be managed only by the user who created it

    * is not affected if the access token that was used to create it is revoked, as
    long as the user remains active


    A webhook that is created by a [third-party app](#section/Third-party-App-Development):


    * is owned by the user who authorized the third-party app (and is associated with
    the third-party app)

    * can be managed by the third-party app (as long as it maintains authorization)
    or by the user who owns it

    * is permanently disabled if the third-party app's permissions are revoked


    ## Webhook Scope & Events


    A webhook monitors the specified **scope** for the specified **events**.


    A [Webhook object's](../../tag/webhooksObjects#section/Webhook-Object) **scope**
    attribute indicates the scope of the subscription. It is specified when [creating
    a webhook](../../tag/webhooksDescription#section/Creating-a-Webhook), and cannot
    subsequently be changed.


    * Currently, **sheet** is the only supported value for the **scope** attribute.
    However, you can set an array of columns as a **subscope** if you want to limit
    the webhook to specific columns.


    A [Webhook object's](../../tag/webhooksObjects#section/Webhook-Object) **event**
    attribute indicates the set of events that a webhook is subscribed to (that is,
    which events trigger a callback).


    * Events are represented as a dot-separated string in the format "*object*.*event*",
    where an asterisk (&#42;) can be used to represent "all objects" or "all events".

    * Currently, <b>&#42;.&#42;</b> is the only supported value for the **events**
    attribute. This indicates a subscription to all objects in the scope, and all
    events for those objects.


    NOTE: When a row is deleted on a sheet, even if you are using a <b>subscope</b>
    to monitor columns only and the cell in that column for that row is empty, you
    will receive a "row.deleted" event.


    ## Example


    Consider a [Webhook object](../../tag/webhooksObjects#section/Webhook-Object)
    with the following attribute values:


    * **scopeObjectId** = 12345678901234

    * **scope** = "sheet"

    * **events** = "&#42;.&#42;"


    This webhook monitors the specified sheet (id: 12345678901234) for all types of
    events. For example, if a row is added to the sheet, cell values are updated in
    the sheet, a column is deleted from the sheet, etc., a callback is sent to the
    webhook's **callbackUrl**.


    # Creating a Webhook


    An API client can create a webhook by using the [Create Webhook](../../tag/webhooks#operation/createWebhook)
    operation. A newly created webhook is disabled by default.

    After successfully creating a webhook, the API client must subsequently initiate
    and complete the [verification process](../../tag/webhooksDescription#section/Creating-a-Webhook/Webhook-Verification)
    before the webhook is enabled.

    The following diagram illustrates the process of creating and enabling a webhook.


    <img src="/images/v4-CreateAndEnableWebhook.png" alt="Workflow to create a webhook"
    />


    ## Step-by-Step:


    The process occurs synchronously:


    1. API client submits a [Create Webhook](../../tag/webhooks#operation/createWebhook)
    request.


    2. Smartsheet creates the webhook, but does not initially enable the webhook (**enabled:
    false** and **status: "NEW_NOT_VERIFIED"**).


    3. To initiate the verification process, the API client submits an [Update Webhook](../../tag/webhooks#operation/updateWebhook)
    request to specify **enabled: true**. (**NOTE:** The API client does not receive
    a response to this request until the verification process (steps 4 and 5) has
    completed.)


    4. When Smartsheet receives the request to enable the webhook, it sends a [verification
    request](#section/Creating-a-Webhook/Webhook-Verification) to the subscriber (that
    is, to the **callbackUrl** that the API client specified in the Create Webhook
    request).

    The request specifies a unique random value in the **Smartsheet-Hook-Challenge**
    header and contains only **challenge** and **webhookId** in the request body.
    The **challenge** value is a repeat of the header value for API clients that don't
    interpret header values.


    5. The subscriber responds to the verification request by echoing back the same
    unique random value in the **Smartsheet-Hook-Response** header of the response.
    For API clients that don't interpret header values, you can also send a JSON body
    with a **smartsheetHookResponse** attribute and the same value that would have
    been in the header.


    6. Once the subscriber has successfully acknowledged the verification request,
    Smartsheet enables the webhook and responds to the API client's Update Webhook
    request to confirm that the webhook has been enabled (**enabled: true** and **status:
    "ENABLED"**).


    ## Webhook Verification


    When an API client attempts to enable a webhook, Smartsheet sends a verification
    request to the webhook's **callbackUrl** to verify that the subscriber expects
    and is able to successfully receive callbacks.

    The request specifies a unique random value in the **Smartsheet-Hook-Challenge**
    header and contains a JSON object in the request body with only **challenge**
    and **webhookId** attributes in the request body. The **challenge** attribute
    is a repeat of the header value for API clients that don't interpret header values.


    * To verify the webhook, the subscriber's response to the verification request
    must return a 200 HTTP status code and must echo back the same unique random value
    in the **Smartsheet-Hook-Response** header of the response or with a JSON **smartsheetHookResponse**
    attribute. Once Smartsheet receives this verification response, the webhook is
    enabled (**enabled: true** and **status: "ENABLED"**).


    * If the subscriber does not successfully respond to the verification request,
    the webhook remains disabled (**enabled: false** and **status: "DISABLED_VERIFICATION_FAILED"**).


    When a webhook is initially [created through the API](#operation/createWebhook),
    the response contains the webhook's Id.  If you wish to guarantee that your server
    only receives callbacks for webhooks that you created,

    you can check the verification request's **webhookId** attribute against your
    list of created webhook Ids.  If the Id is not in the list, return a response
    with a non-200 status code (for example, 403 Forbidden),

    and the webhook that initiated the verification request is disabled as described
    above.


    NOTE: <b>IMPORTANT:</b> ONGOING VERIFICATION. Once a webhook has been enabled,
    Smartsheet sends a verification request to the webhook's <b>callbackUrl</b> once
    every 100 callbacks. The subscriber should respond to the verification request
    as described above -- failure to do so results in the webhook being disabled (<b>enabled:
    false</b> and <b>status: "DISABLED_VERIFICATION_FAILED"</b>).


    # Webhook Status


    A [Webhook](#section/Webhook-Object) object's **enabled** attribute indicates
    whether a webhook is enabled or disabled, while the **status** attribute describes
    the *reason* that the webhook is enabled or disabled.


    The following table lists all possible combinations of **enabled** and **status**
    attribute values.


    Webhook.enabled | Webhook.status | Meaning | Notes

    ----- | ----- | ------ | -----

    false  | **DISABLED_ADMINISTRATIVE** | Webhook has been disabled by Smartsheet
    support. | A webhook in this state can only be re-enabled by Smartsheet (contact
    <a href="mailto:api@smartsheet.com">api@smartsheet.com</a>).  Attempting to re-enable
    a webhook in this state results in error code 1154.

    false  | **DISABLED_APP_REVOKED** | Webhook has been disabled because the third-party
    app associated with the webhook has had its access revoked. | This is a terminal
    state (that is, webhook in this state cannot be re-enabled, and attempts to do
    so result in error code 1153). If the third-party app's access is subsequently
    restored, it must create new webhooks.

    false  | **DISABLED_BY_OWNER** | Webhook has been disabled by the owner. | Owner
    can re-enable the webhook by using the [Update Webhook](../../tag/webhooks#operation/updateWebhook)
    operation to set **enabled** to **true**. Once the subscriber successfully acknowledges
    the [verification request](#section/Creating-a-Webhook/Webhook-Verification),
    the webhook is enabled.

    false  | **DISABLED_CALLBACK_FAILED** | Webhook has been disabled because callback
    was not successfully delivered to the callback URL. |  Owner can re-enable the
    webhook by using the [Update Webhook](../../tag/webhooks#operation/updateWebhook)
    operation to set **enabled** to **true**. Once the subscriber successfully acknowledges
    the [verification request](#section/Creating-a-Webhook/Webhook-Verification),
    the webhook is enabled.

    false  | **DISABLED_SCOPE_INACCESSIBLE** | Webhook has been disabled because its
    owner lost access to the corresponding data in Smartsheet (either because the
    object was deleted or sharing permissions were revoked). | Webhook is automatically
    re-enabled if access to data is restored (for example, if deleted object is restored
    or sharing permissions are restored).

    false  | **DISABLED_VERIFICATION_FAILED** | Webhook verification has failed. |  Owner
    can re-enable the webhook by using the [Update Webhook](../../tag/webhooks#operation/updateWebhook)
    operation to set **enabled** to **true**. Once the subscriber successfully acknowledges
    the [verification request](#section/Creating-a-Webhook/Webhook-Verification),
    the webhook is enabled.

    true  | **ENABLED** | Webhook is active. |

    false | **NEW_NOT_VERIFIED** | Webhook has been created but is not enabled because
    it has not yet been verified. |  Owner can re-enable the webhook by using the
    [Update Webhook](../../tag/webhooks#operation/updateWebhook) operation to set
    **enabled** to **true**. Once the subscriber successfully acknowledges the [verification
    request](#section/Creating-a-Webhook/Webhook-Verification), the webhook is enabled.


    **NOTES:**


    * When a Webhook object's <b>enabled</b> attribute is set to <b>true</b>, Smartsheet
    is monitoring for the specified events and sends a [callback](#section/Webhook-Callbacks/Event-Callbacks)
    to the <b>callbackUrl</b> when the events occur.

    * When a Webhook object's <b>enabled</b> attribute is set to <b>false</b>, Smartsheet
    is not monitoring for the specified events and does not send a callback to the
    <b>callbackUrl</b> when the events occur. Depending on the value of the <b>status</b>
    attribute, it may be possible to (re-)enable the webhook. (See below for details).


    # Webhook Callbacks


    A callback is the notification that Smartsheet sends to a webhook's **callbackUrl**.
    There are two types of callbacks:


    * [Event callback](#section/Webhook-Callbacks/Event-Callbacks): Alerts the subscriber
    when the specified events have occurred in Smartsheet. This is the most common
    type of callback.


    * [Status Change callback](#section/Webhook-Callbacks/Status-Change-Callbacks):
    Alerts the subscriber that a webhook has been automatically disabled due to loss
    of access or automatically re-enabled due to restoration of access.


    A Subscriber has the ability to verify the integrity of a callback payload (that
    is, ensure that the message was not tampered with en route) and authenticate the
    identity of its sender (that is, ensure that the callback did indeed originate
    from Smartsheet).

    For more information, see [Authenticating Callbacks](#section/Webhook-Callbacks/Authenticating-Callbacks-(optional)).


    **NOTES:**


    * Smartsheet webhooks do not support callbacks to servers using self-signed certificates.
    The callback server must be using a signed certificate from a certificate authority.

    * The callbackURL cannot be a private IP address.

    * The callbackURL must use one of the following ports: 443 (default for HTTPS),
    8000, 8008, 8080, or 8443.


    ## Event Callbacks


    Smartsheet sends an event callback to notify the subscriber when the specified
    events occur in Smartsheet.


    WARNING: Any events that occur while a webhook is disabled are not communicated
    via callback if/when webhook is enabled.


    ## Callback Acknowledgement


    The subscriber must respond to an event callback with a 200 [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#2xx_Success)
    to acknowledge that the callback was received.


    ## Retry Logic


    If the subscriber fails to respond with a 200 status, depending on the response,
    Smartsheet may retry delivery up to 14 times. (The first 7 retry attempts occur
    with a frequency that's determined using exponential backoff; thereafter, retry
    attempts occur once every three hours until all retries have been exhausted.)


    Subscriber response | Is retried?

    ----- | -----

    HTTP 201 through 299 | No

    HTTP 309 through 399 | No

    HTTP 400 through 499 (except 410) | Yes

    HTTP 410 | No

    HTTP 500 through 599 | Yes

    Any other HTTP status | No

    Request timeout | Yes


    If the response is not retriable or retry attempts have been exhausted, the webhook
    is disabled (**enabled: false** and **status: "DISABLED_CALLBACK_FAILED"**).

    A webhook in this state can be re-enabled if the subscriber completes the verification
    process. (See [Webhook Status](#section/Webhook-Status) for details.)


    ## Status Change Callbacks


    If a webhook's owner loses access to the object that a webhook is monitoring (either
    because the object was deleted or the webhook owner's access to the object was
    revoked in Smartsheet),

    Smartsheet automatically disables the webhook and sends a status change callback
    to alert the subscriber of this change in status.

    The **newWebhookStatus** attribute indicates that the webhook is now disabled
    (because the scope is inaccessible).


    If the webhook owner's access to the object is subsequently restored,

    Smartsheet automatically re-enables the webhook and sends a status change callback
    to alert the subscriber of this change in status.

    The **newWebhookStatus** attribute indicates that the webhook is now enabled.


    ## Authenticating Callbacks (optional)


    A subscriber has the ability to verify the integrity of a callback payload (that
    is, ensure that the message was not tampered with en route) and authenticate the
    identity of its sender (that is, ensure that the callback did indeed originate
    from Smartsheet).


    When you create a new [webhook](#section/Webhook-Object), it is assigned a randomly
    generated **sharedSecret** value.  The shared secret is used by Smartsheet to
    sign callback payloads, and should not be shared with any third parties.


    To authenticate a callback request:


    1. Calculate the [HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code)
    of the webhook's **sharedSecret** and the request body.  This must be done using
    the [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) cryptographic hash algorithm.


    2. Format the calculated value as a string in base 16.


    3. Compare your result with the value of the **Smartsheet-Hmac-SHA256** header
    of the request.


    If the values match, you can be sure the request originated from Smartsheet and
    that the data has not been tampered with.


    NOTE: For maximum security, you may also choose to [reset your webhook's shared
    secret](../../tag/webhooks#operation/resetSharedSecret) at periodic intervals.


    # Preventing Infinite Loops


    It's possible that an application which subscribes to callbacks (using webhooks)
    might react to those callbacks by using the API to make additional changes in
    Smartsheet.

    But, consider the following scenario:


    1. **App1** creates a webhook to monitor **Sheet-A** for changes, specifying an
    **App-1** URL as the **callbackUrl** for the webhook.


    2. **App-1** updates **Sheet-A** using the API.


    3. Smartsheet detects that **Sheet-A** has changed and sends a callback to **App-1**
    (as the webhook specified).


    4. **App-1** processes the callback, and in the course of doing so, updates **Sheet-A**
    again using the API.


    5. Return to Step 3.


    To protect against infinite loops like the one outlined above, Smartsheet introduced
    support for a new header that an API client can include with any API request that
    adds, updates, or deletes data in Smartsheet.

    Here's how it works:


    * An API client includes the **Smartsheet-Change-Agent** header in any API request
    that adds, updates, or deletes data in Smartsheet.
      * The header value should be set to a string that the API client recognizes
    as identifying itself.
    * If any [event callbacks](../../tag/webhooksObjects#section/CallbackEvent-Object)
    fire as a result of an API request that contains the **Smartsheet-Change-Agent**
    header, the value of the **Smartsheet-Change-Agent** header is included in the
    [callback](../../tag/webhooksObjects#section/Callback-Object) in the value of
    the **changeAgent** attribute.

    * If a webhook subscriber receives a [callback](../../tag/webhooksObjects#section/Callback-Object)
    that contains the **changeAgent** attribute, it should evaluate the attribute
    value:
      * If the attribute value's comma-delimited list contains the subscriber API
    client's change agent value, this indicates that the change which triggered the
    callback *was* caused by the subscriber itself, and the subscriber can choose
    to ignore the callback, thus preventing an infinite loop.
      * Else, the change which triggered the callback was *not* caused by the subscriber
    itself, and if the subscriber is going to subsequently react to the callback by
    making a change in Smartsheet (via API request), the API client should append
    a comma and its own identifier to the original attribute value, and pass that
    value through using the **Smartsheet-Change-Agent** header of the API request.
    Doing so protects against cross-system infinite loops.

    NOTE: The <b>Smartsheet-Change-Agent</b> header value has a maximum length of
    512 characters. If its length exceeds 512 characters, the excess is trimmed from
    the front of the string, so that the most recent agent information remains.


    # Webhook Errors


    The following table specifies the recommended action for each Smartsheet-specific
    error code.

    Use this information to implement error handling logic according to the following
    guidelines:


    * If the error code indicates a permanent error condition, do not retry the request.

    * If the error code indicates a problem that can be fixed, do not retry the request
    until the problem has been fixed.

    * If the error code indicates a problem that could be overcome by retrying the
    request after a period of time, retry the request using exponential backoff.


    HTTP status code | Smartsheet errorCode | Smartsheet message | Recommended Action
    |

    -----|-----|-----|-----|

    400 | 1151 | Scope '{0}', object id {1} was not found. | Do not retry without
    fixing the problem.

    400 | 1152 | Only URLs with a protocol of 'https' are supported for attribute
    '{0}'. | Do not retry without fixing the problem.

                              event. Usually the userId property and the requestUserId
                              property (below) have the same value. However, if the
                              request is an API call with Assume-User header then
                              the userId property identifies the user whose email
                              matches the value in the Assume-User header.
                            type: number

                              if the request is an API call with an access token then
                              requestUserId identifies the user whose data can be
                              accessed via the access token (i.e., the user who authorized
                              the creation of the access token). On the other hand,
                              if the request comes from a UI session, then requestUserId
                              identifies the user logged-in to the UI.

                              (only access tokens generated via the Smartsheet desktop
                              UI can be given a name at creation time).

        Note the following:

        * Both sheetName and the file name must use ASCII characters.

        * The source data must be basic text. To include rich formula data, import
        and create a sheet first, and then use Update Rows. To work with images, see
        Cell Images.

        * XLS is not supported. You must use XLSX.

        * Hierarchical relationships between rows in an external file won't import.

        Imports CSV or XLSX data into a new sheet in the top-level "Sheets"
        folder.


        Note the following:

        * Both sheetName and the file name must use ASCII characters.

        * The source data must be basic text. To include rich formula data, import
        and create a sheet first, and then use Update Rows. To work with images, see
        Cell Images.

        * XLS is not supported. You must use XLSX.

        * Hierarchical relationships between rows in an external file won't import.

        **NOTE:**

        * You cannot change the type of a Primary column.

        * While dependencies are enabled on a sheet, you can't change the type of
        any special calendar/Gantt columns.

        * If the column type is changed, all cells in the column are converted to
        the new column type and column validation is cleared.

        * Type is optional when moving or renaming, but required when changing type
        or dropdown values.

          **NOTE:**

          * Column Ids must be valid for the sheet to which the row belongs, and must
          only be used once for each row in the operation.

          * Cells of a project sheet in the "Finish Date" column cannot be updated
          via API.

          * Cells of a project sheet in the "Start Date" column cannot be updated
          via API for rows that contain a value in the "Predecessor" column.

          * Max length for a cell value is 4000 characters after which truncation
          occurs without warning. Empty string values are converted to null.

          * Calculation errors or problems with a formula do not cause the API call
          to return an error code. Instead, the response contains the same value as
          in the UI, such as cell.value = "#CIRCULAR REFERENCE".

            When **allowPartialSuccess=false** (or not specified):


            If an error occurs, the [Error object](../../tag/commonObjects#section/Error-Object)
            returned contains a **detail** attribute set to an object with the following
            attribute:

            * **index**: the array index of the row that caused the error (0 if a
            single Row was passed in)


            If any error occurs, the entire request fails (no rows are added), and
            the error response returned describes the first problem that was encountered.
            For example:

            ```

            {
              "errorCode": 1042,
              "message": "The cell value in column 5504245941200772 did not conform
            to the strict requirements for type CHECKBOX."
              "detail": {
                "index": 4
              }
            }

            ```


            When **allowPartialSuccess=true**:


            When partial success is enabled, and one or more of the objects in the
            request fail to be added/updated/deleted, a standard [Result object](../../tag/commonObjects#section/Result-Object)
            is returned, but with a **message** of **'PARTIAL_SUCCESS'** (instead
            of **'SUCCESS'**), and a **resultCode** of **3**. Additionally, the object
            contains a **failedItems** attribute -- an array of [BulkItemFailure objects](../../tag/commonObjects#section/BulkItemFailure-Object)
            that contains an item for each object in the request that failed to be
            added/updated/deleted.

          See [Column Types](../../tag/columnsRelated#section/Column-Types) for more
          information.


          **NOTE:**

          * Column Ids must be valid for the sheet to which the row belongs, and must
          only be used once for each row in the operation.

          * Cells of a project sheet in the "Finish Date" column cannot be updated
          via API.

          * Cells of a project sheet in the "Start Date" column cannot be updated
          via API for rows that contain a value in the "Predecessor" column.

          * Max length for a cell value is 4000 characters after which truncation
          occurs without warning. Empty string values are converted to null.

          * Calculation errors or problems with a formula do not cause the API call
          to return an error code. Instead, the response contains the same value as
          in the UI, such as cell.value = "#CIRCULAR REFERENCE".

            When **allowPartialSuccess=false** (or not specified):


            If an error occurs, the [Error object](../../tag/commonObjects#section/Error-Object)
            returned contains a **detail** attribute set to an object with the following
            attribute:

            * **index**: the array index of the row that caused the error (0 if a
            single Row was passed in)

            * **rowId**: the id of the row that caused the error (omitted if the row
            was missing an Id)


            If any error occurs, the entire request fails (no rows are added), and
            the error response returned describes the first problem that was encountered.
            For example:

            ```

            {

            "errorCode": 1042,

            "message": "The cell value in column 5504245941200772 did not conform
            to the strict requirements for type CHECKBOX."

            "detail": {
              "index": 4
              "rowId": 6572427401553796
              }
            }

            ```

            When **allowPartialSuccess=true**:


            When partial success is enabled, and one or more of the objects in the
            request fail to be added/updated/deleted, a standard [Result object](../../tag/commonObjects#section/Result-Object)
            is returned, but with a **message** of **'PARTIAL_SUCCESS'** (instead
            of **'SUCCESS'**), and a **resultCode** of **3**. Additionally, the object
            contains a **failedItems** attribute -- an array of [BulkItemFailure objects](../../tag/commonObjects#section/BulkItemFailure-Object)
            that contains an item for each object in the request that failed to be
            added/updated/deleted.

          See [Row Include Flags](../../tag/rowsRelated#section/Row-Include-Flags).


          Also supports the **columns** include flag, which adds a columns array that
          specifies all of the columns for the sheet. This enables you to have the
          full context of the cells in the row.


          The **filters** include flag returns a **filteredOut** attribute indicating
          if the row should be displayed or hidden according to the sheet's filters.

      description: >
        Uploads an image to the user profile.


        Uploading a profile image differs from Adding an Image to a Cell in the following
        ways:
          * A **Content-Length** header is not required
          * Allowable file types are limited to: gif, jpg, and png
          * Maximum file size is determined by the following rules:
              * If you have not defined a custom size and the image is larger than
        1050 x 1050 pixels, Smartsheet scales the image down to 1050 x 1050
              * If you have defined a custom size, Smartsheet uses that as the file
        size max
          * If the image is not square, Smartsheet uses a solid color to pad the image

        A webhook is not enabled by default when it is created.

        Once you've created a webhook, you can enable it by using the Update Webhook
        operation to set **enabled** to **true**.


        When a row is deleted on a sheet, even if you are using a **subscope** to
        monitor columns only

        and the cell in that column for that row is empty, you will receive a "row.deleted"
        event.

        Note the following:

        * Both sheetName and the file name must use ASCII characters.

        * The source data must be basic text. To include rich formula data, import
        and create a sheet first, and then use Update Rows. To work with images, see
        Cell Images.

        * XLS is not supported. You must use XLSX.

        * Hierarchical relationships between rows in an external file won't import.

        never to change or be removed for a given major API version.  However, new
        values could potentially be added to the ends of lookup tables. Because of
        this possibility, your code should handle the case where a cell might contain
        a format index value greater than the size of a lookup table your app has
        loaded. Your application should check for that case and reload the format
        tables if necessary.

            are guaranteed never to change or be removed for a given major API version.  However,
            new values could potentially be added to the ends of lookup tables. Because
            of this possibility, your code should handle the case where a cell might
            contain a format index value greater than the size of a lookup table your
            app has loaded. Your application should check for that case and reload
            the format tables if necessary.
