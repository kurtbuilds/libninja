# `libninja`

`libninja` is a tool for generating world-class, idiomatic client libraries from OpenAPI specs.

The best way to see it in action is to see what it produces.

[`plaid-rs`](https://github.com/libninjacom/plaid-rs) is generated entirely by Libninja. This includes:
- The client library itself
- Idiomatic interface, where required arguments are passed directly or as part of a struct, and optional arguments are included via method chaining.
- Documentation is published online (docs.rs), and crate is published to registry (crates.io)
- `examples/` folder containing an example for every API endpoint
- The API client has the ability to record/replay requests, greatly aiding development for end users.
- API documentation is included in function docstrings, so it's available inline in the editor. The docstrings also include links to plaid's hosted API documentation.
- Github Action .yaml files to run tests and publish the package to package registries
- README that includes badges (that showcase a Green passing build) and usage examples

All of that is created with this command:

```bash
libninja gen --lang rust --repo libninjacom/plaid-rs -o . Plaid ~/path/to/plaid/openapi.yaml
```

# Installation

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/kurtbuilds/libninja
```

Use the command line help to see required arguments & options when generating libraries.

The open source version builds client libraries for Rust. Libninja also supports other languages with a commercial license. Reach out at the email in author Github profile.

# Advanced usage

## Deriving traits for generated structs

You can derive traits for the generated structs by passing them using one (or many) `--derive` arguments:

```bash
libninja gen --lang rust --repo libninjacom/plaid-rs --derive oasgen::OaSchema -o . Plaid ~/path/to/plaid/openapi.yaml 
```

Make sure to add the referenced crate(s) (and any necessary features) to your `Cargo.toml`:

```bash
cargo add oasgen --features chrono
```

Then, the traits will be added to the `derive` attribute on the generated `model` and `request` structs:
```rust
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
use super::Glossary;
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize, Default, oasgen::OaSchema)]
pub struct ListGlossariesResponse {
    #[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none")]
    pub glossaries: Option<Vec<Glossary>>,
}
```

## Customizing generation further

There are two ways to customize codegen, first by modifying the OpenAPI spec, and second, using a file template system.

During codegen, `libninja` will look for a directory called `template`, and use files there to customize the generated code.

For example, if libninja generates `src/model/user.rs`, it will check for `template/src/model/user.rs`.

If it's found, `libninja` will try to intelligently interpolate generated code with the templated file. The specific order of items in the output file will be:

1. codegen docstring
2. codegen imports
3. template imports
4. template items (structs, enums, traits, impl, etc)
5. codegen items

Alternatively, if the string `libninja: static` is found in the file template, it will ignore all codegen for that file, and pass the template file through as-is.

# Development

If you run into errors about a missing `commericial` package, run the command `just dummy_commercial` to create a dummy
package.
